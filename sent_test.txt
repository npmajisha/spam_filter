NEG i had some expectation for the movie , since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif . well , i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 ; but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan , i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic . < br / > < br / > when i saw the credits at the beginning , i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way . well , the very first scene itself pis * ed me off . then , the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences . me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights . it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns ! phew . . . you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are . < br / > < br / > the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story . it reminded me of some of the early 80 ' s movies . < br / > < br / > well , the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena , who looked really hot in this one . and for that , i give a rating of 2 out of 10 . < br / > < br / > guys , please . . please . . . don ' t see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie . well , you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes . < br / > < br / > thats all . 
NEG if there is one film which is the worst of this year - it ' s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom 2 style film , and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock , it was even worst then dhoom 2 and what i expected first saif ' s introduction which is boring then saif - kareena meet , kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god , what he is doing in such a weird film ? what kinda role it is ? what acting is he doing ? his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes , but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance , overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke < br / > < br / > vijay krishna acharya would have got 3 films more to direct , if this film had worked , thats the strategy of yashraj , only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music ( vishal shekhar ) is ordinary < br / > < br / > performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air , he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating , kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay 
NEG this movie is horrible . the acting is a waste basket . no crying , no action , hopeless songs . though the scenery is great . i have always wanted to go to greece . < br / > < br / > anyway , as for saif , you ' d expect a great performance , but even he let down the people . < br / > < br / > akshay kumar , recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs . he was sensational in this movie . for only this performance , filmfare should introduce another award . the toiletries award for the worst performance . by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat . < br / > < br / > kareena kapoor . she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma . in acting , in looks , or in body . she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her . she comes into this movie wearing bikini ' s and tank tops and short shorts . i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife - to - be dress like that . but , she must ' ve impressed some people dressing like that . and if you ask how , then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie . they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom . including me . personally i think that she dressed like a whore , but i really liked it . < br / > < br / > i am forced to give it a 1 / 10 , but i ' d really give this movie a 0 / 10 . an unachieved film . 
NEG all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure , but this is not the case . vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor . she was unbearable throughout the film . her tom - boy look does not really goes well . even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all . everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin . the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie . anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not . akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif . the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed 
NEG i ' ve now written reviews for several of the moh episodes , and this is among the worst . an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll . if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you ( " let ' s check out the basement ! " ) , then this is your show . except , it ' s not amusing or entertaining - it ' s just annoying . < br / > < br / > the extent of the virus is never , ever showed . i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only , as the resulting situation is very , very frightening . but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home , and ultimately dies at his hands . the woman flees north , and runs into a few tens situations . then , some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her ( things that make you go huh ? ) . or something . then , she is huddling for warmth . the end . < br / > < br / > awful . these directors are mailing this tripe in . 
NEG zombie nation 2004 r < br / > < br / > hey , i was bored . i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch . zombie nation ? hey , i love zombie movies . says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description . funny how it doesn ' t warn me not to watch this film . i could ' ve used that advice . < br / > < br / > zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that it ' s completely misnamed . it has little ( if anything , depending on your point of view ) to do with zombies , and takes place all within one city . this film revolves around a crooked cop , who acts as badly as possible ( he has to be trying to suck this much ) , while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them . yup , he ' s a serial killer cop . not only is this film flawed in thinking that it ' s a zombie flick , it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong . serial killers enjoy killing , they live for it and they get down and personal with it . this guy knocks out the women , and injects them with some poison . he doesn ' t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it . talk about boring ! eventually , one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason , all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy . they were all buried or tossed into the ocean , but you wouldn ' t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they ' re all wearing . the women then act very poorly and take their revenge . oh yay . < br / > < br / > this film was crap in every category . crap acting , crap writing , crappier sets , and crappier make - up effects . the women don ' t look zombie - like , unless you count really dark make - up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie . they can all talk , behave , think , and act perfectly human . the gore is weak compared to even many pg - 13 films and the nudity is beyond brief . you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence . . . then the exact same breasts later ! go figure . guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite . the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they ' re obviously filming in . you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set - up and even , unless you are blind , you can see the director failing . steer clear , it ' s a waste of time . < br / > < br / > 1 / 10 
NEG unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes . < br / > < br / > the plot - even for a seagal film , the plot is just stupid . i mean its not just bad , its barely coherent . < br / > < br / > the acting - unbelievably wooden . literally seen better acting in porno ' s . ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a ' lesbian love scene ' which is utterly cringe - worthy . < br / > < br / > special effects - wouldn ' t look out of place in a 60 ' s sword and sorcery flick . < br / > < br / > unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures , don ' t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd , as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back . 
NEG first of all , f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft . < br / > < br / > secondly , the f14 ' s and f18 ' s cannot change their appearances ; they are not transformers . < br / > < br / > thirdly , the f16 has only one m61 cannon , not two . < br / > < br / > last but not the least , at the end of the film , seagle selected sidewinder missile . but somehow when he pulled the trigger , the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick . as i have the experience of seeing f18 ' s and f14 ' s being mysteriously transformed into f16 ' s , this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me . however , there is still one question i have to ask : how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 . . . < br / > < br / > when students hand in really bad work , teachers assign 0 ' s . now i think for the sake of properly marking this film , imdb should seriously consider adding a ' 0 / 10 ' option . otherwise , it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 . . . 
NEG i usually don ' t comment anything ( i read the others opinions ) . . . but this , this one i _have_ to comment . . . i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action , f - 117 and other hi - tech stuff , but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind . . . lousy acting , lousy script and a big science fiction . < br / > < br / > it ' s one of the worst movies i have ever seen . . . < br / > < br / > simply . . . don ' t bother . . . < br / > < br / > and one more thing , before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site . . . 3 . 7 points and i give this movie a try , now i ' m wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
NEG i really didn ' t expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv , which is were i live , acting in it . this town is dull and so is this film . there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show . this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn ' t any . unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday , then stay away from this movie . the dialog will put you to sleep , the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this . its a predictable movie with no surprises . what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator . 
NEG san francisco is a big city with great acting credits . in this one , the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city . they didn ' t even manage the most basic of realistic details . so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie . you will not be thinking " oh , i ' ve been there , " you will be thinking " how did a two story firetrap / stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby ? " some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations . it detracts , but the acting was always competent . < br / > < br / > the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles , at least in the beginning . the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting . the plot is weak , ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies . the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance , they were framed and paced better . but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries . < br / > < br / > the white boy intro was pointless . i think the filmmakers didn ' t know what to do with it , so they left it loosely structured and cut it down . the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal - really , folks , everyone knows it ' s not " groovy " to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous . they threw away some good opportunities . educated and embittered on the west coast , a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york . they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable . that would have been interesting ; this was not . < br / > < br / > the hunter ' s point intro was the most disappointing . it was the most derivative of the three , and stylistically the most distant from san francisco . you ' ve seen it done before and you ' ve seen it done better . even the video game was better ! < br / > < br / > despite the generic non - locality and aimless script , these characters have potential , the actors have talent , and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction . . . about ten minutes before the ending . good concept placed in the wrong hands . < br / > < br / > ps , there is a missing minority here , see if you can guess which one . 
NEG no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie . it ' s just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch . bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction . students fist - fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue . the watts riots with a cast of . . . ugh . . . 10 ? ? dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look - alike with the most annoying smile since ' mr . sardonicus ' . noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift . drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service . silly , giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of ' shindig ' , sing horribly off key , and actually make it big in the music business . and who wrote this compelling dialog ? : " i ' m going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair " . . . . " i think i found someone to buy stick ' s woody ! " . . . . " these people are ' animals ' ! " " these people are my ' family ' ! as the shirelles sing " mama said " . oh brother , what a mess . this is like a ' reefer madness ' of the 60 ' s except it ' s not even funny . 
NEG this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can ' t believe they dumped cleveland . ( yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good , and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league , but still be consistent . ) anyway i loved the first major league , liked the second , and always looked forward to the third , when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can ' t tell me this wasn ' t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened ? anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don ' t watch this junk .

NEG well , the writing was very sloppy , the directing was sloppier , and the editing made it worse ( at least i hope it was the editing ) . the acting wasn ' t bad , but it wasn ' t that good either . pretty much none of the characters were likable . at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential . it was a great idea , but yet another wasted good idea goes by . it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending . and what wasn ' t predictable was done so badly that it didn ' t matter . the ending was not worth watching at all . sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies . the movie looked rushed also . the movie just wasn ' t really worth seeing , and had i paid for it i would have been very mad . maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one . the movie over all was not horrifibly bad , but i wouldn ' t reccomend it . i gave it 2 out of 10 b / c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character ( justin i believe , the super smart one ) . and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes . it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape , it was not pretty . anyway , if you see it , wait for the $ 1 . 50 theater or video , unless you like pretty much every movie you see , then i guess you ' ll like this one . 
NEG except for acknowledging some nice cinematography , i can hardly say anything positive about this movie . the single real issue is the protagonist ' s dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life . abundant " emotionally powerful " scenes do not go with this plot and , because of bad acting , they also fail to create the intended atmosphere . the director only manages to introduce anthony ' s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution . the characters do not seem to evolve , although it is difficult to speak of any characters . . . perhaps except for sonny . beside him , actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to , they come off as self - indulging amateurs . i wonder what ruined the movie more : the superficial script , throwing away all the potential of the plot , or the bad acting , disturbing any appeal that might be left . 
NEG dick foran and peggy moran , who were so good together in the mummy ' s hand , return for this very minor universal horror offering . but this time , instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick " babe , " we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named " stuff " . but the results are nowhere near as charming , and the scare level is virtually nil . < br / > < br / > dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as " the phantom " who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself . < br / > < br / > this " phantom " is not very mysterious , and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . it ' s always nice to see perky moran , but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal ' s instantly forgettable misfires . 
NEG * * spoilers contained * * < br / > < br / > i ' d heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . what i didn ' t expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . what starts off as a typical cowboy / indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic ' comedy ' about honus ( soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss ) and cresta ( candice bergen ) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne . the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . they then escape and both turn up ( separately ) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base . as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . so far so ordinary . then comes the ending . after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they / won ' t they get together storyline , the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn ' t resort to extreme gratuitous violence . in some ways , soldier blue reminds me of frank perry ' s last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . i didn ' t hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents , i would recommend elem klimov ' s come and see . 
NEG this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . well there ' s nothing wrong with that , except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age . it ' s almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves . the movie has no plot . it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath . there are some funny scenes and comedic bits . but they don ' t redeem the flat monotony . < br / > < br / > the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do , and not done very well at that . anything that can ' t be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation . < br / > < br / > i went to see this film after seeing the trailer , which makes it look like a tarrentino piece . well , the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get . ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane , inane comedy . it works at times , but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over . it ' s more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie . it ' s a hit - you - over - the - head - with - it kind of comedy . i can see where the story idea is intriguing . but , in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england . in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era . he plans to make a part 2 . i guess he thinks he ' s tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing . < br / > < br / > at the opening in la , wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 . he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one , to which he replied , well yea , sure . 
NEG this piece ain ' t really worth a comment . . it ' s simply the worst " horror " movie i have ever seen . the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry . shame on you i say ! ! 
NEG i feel totally ripped off . someone needs to refund the $ 4 . 95 i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess . this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening . what i don ' t get is why did this get distributed in the first place ? ? ? . . . somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made . i ' ve seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact . the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view . . . shot on dv ? ? ? nuff said . the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section . want to see a good musical ? then don ' t rent this movie . 
NEG after watching a dozen episodes , i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling . in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models , i thought that my profession was being joked about . i am not a mathematician , instead a chemical engineer , but i do work a lot with mathematical models . so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to " make - believe " of fairy tales . < br / > < br / > first , choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task . charlie eppes is shown as a genius , but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model , specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future . individuals are erratic and haphazard , there is no modeling for them . isaac asimov even wrote about that in the 1950 ' s . even if there were a model for specific kind of individual , it would be a probabilistic ( stoichastic ) one , meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction . < br / > < br / > second , supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found , the model parameters have to be known . these parameters are the constants of the equations , such as the gravity acceleration ( 9 . 8 m / s2 ) , and often are not easy to determine . again , charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses . and after the model and the parameters are chosen , they would have to be tested . oddly , they are not , and by miracle , they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted . < br / > < br / > third , a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected , not only by numbers , but also by sci - fi movies : the computational effort required for solving these models . try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job . even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models , he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow . and even with the right software / hardware combination , the model solution might well take days to be reached . he solves them immediately ! i could use his computer in my research work , i would be very glad . < br / > < br / > as a drama , it is far from being the best show . the characters are somewhat stereotyped , but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are . the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent . < br / > < br / > for some layman , the show might work . for others , the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow ! 
NEG the " math " aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows . the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow , although his career must have been ( undeservedly ) waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock . < br / > < br / > the lame - ness of the " math " aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co - starring lou diamond phillips ( which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned . ) in order to catch a fugitive , the " mathematician " uses some theory about " bubbles " . so , he gives this long explanation that , if we have seen the suspect in places a , b and c , then we can use " bubble theory " to calculate where he might be . he does this all on a chalkboard , or maybe with a stick in the dirt ( i cant remember ) . < br / > < br / > anyway , when you look at the finished product , he basically took three spots , and picked a point right in the middle and said " ok , mathematically , here ' s where we are most likely to find the fugitive . " at which point , one other character points out " oh , that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live . " is that math ? its not even connect - the - f * * k * * g - dots ! ! ! this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to " support " points that every one else had already agreed on through either less - complex analysis or basic common sense . < br / > < br / > it just goes to show - - when you ' re a hammer , everything looks like a nail . i can ' t wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama . . . they ' ll use calculus , call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains , and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields . . . cuz hey . . . its all about the numbers . < br / > < br / > totally ludicrous tv show . 
NEG spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie , lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy / pretty boy act , and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa . oj simpson is a detective , coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona . translation : cable tv filler . there isn ' t enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure . < br / > < br / > the script has some gaping holes . best / worst moment : in one jarring scene , oj ' s partner expresses his aversion to the morgue . oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot , or words to that effect . this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough ; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released , it is truly appalling , and therefore entertaining in an unintentional , horrible way . i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose . now that ' s a guilty pleasure . bc 
NEG while i have never been a fan of the original scooby - doo ( due to its horrid production values ) , it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna - barbera ! without a doubt , scrappy - doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children ( and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm ) . whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby - doo characters with it ? ! whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show ( i think death is preferable ) . the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny , annoying and grates on the nerves - - and this is only in the better episodes ! ! after many years , it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess ! i can see why in the live - action scooby - doo movie they made the villain scrappy - doo - - since practically everyone hates him ! 
NEG this series just gets worse and worse . poorly written and just plain not funny ! the premise is excellent , but the writer ' s inexperience shines through . by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about , and resorted to that patronizing , smug , " oh , silly you " style acting that comes with a no laugh script . they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say , aren ' t we zany ? isn ' t this funny ? well , no , it ' s not actually . gum disease is less painful . no wonder , with the exception of corner gas , canadians generally avoid canadian tv . come on cbc you ' re suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent . pull the plug on this amateurish mess . 
NEG i only recently found out that madeleine l ' engle ' s novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd . the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times . < br / > < br / > despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel , the murry family is well cast , with a likable ( if too pretty ) meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating . < br / > < br / > the first half hour is promising enough , doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene . unfortunately as soon as the non - human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart . alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit ( think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead ) and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive , she must have visited faye dunaway ' s plastic surgeon in recent years . for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west . < br / > < br / > in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction . i understand that this is a tv movie , but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier . mrs whatsits ' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast , who in the novel is a velvety , elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here . i could go on and on , nearly every artistic choice is a disaster , presumably because there wasn ' t a large enough budget to do this justice , but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement . < br / > < br / > this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films . what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children ' s literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it ' s sequels for the big screen , giving it the scope it deserves . 
NEG i really didn ' t like this movie because it didn ' t really bring across the messages and ideas l ' engle brought out in her novel . we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it , i ' m afraid i can ' t say the same for the film . there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn ' t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l ' engle ! this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating . don ' t see this movie if you are a big fan of l ' engle ' s texts because you will be sorely disappointed . however , if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes ( or educational as was my case ) then it is an alright movie ! 
NEG the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads ' kushiata kyoto , japan 1840 ' . a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori ( toshiya maruyama ) walks up the winding path to the house , inside waits otami ( mako hattori ) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband , shugoro ' s ( tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki ) back who happens to be masanori ' s teacher . shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other . his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide . over a century later and ted fletcher ( edward albert ) arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura ( susan george ) and their young daughter amy ( amy barrett ) . their close friend alex curtis ( doug mcclure ) who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay , you don ' t need me to you where ! he jokingly says it ' s going so cheap because it ' s haunted , to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don ' t believe in ghosts , at least for the time being that is . almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode . lights turn on and off by themselves , laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk ( henry mitowa ) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it ' s too late which they ignore , of course . the spirits of otami , masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches ( tsuyako olajima ) curse put upon them . but there may be a way they can break the curse , unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage , daughter and possibly even their very lives . < br / > < br / > directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film , ok to watch once if you ' ve got nothing better to do but after a day or two you ' ll probably have completely forgotten it . nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there ' s nothing particularly good about the film either . the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by - the - numbers , a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn ' t help things . there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter , noriko ( mayumi umeda ) . and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in , however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in , some exorcism ! one more thing , i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was 47 when he made this , try his hand at kung - fu and oriental sword fighting ! george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure , although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present . apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there ' s no blood , gore or violence to speak about . the ' transparent ' ghost effects are ok but they ain ' t going to impress many people these days . it ' s professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america , england or any western country without having to change a thing . an ok time waster . 
NEG raising victor vargas is just a bad film . no amount of denial or ad - dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact . < br / > < br / > maybe peter sollett saw he didn ' t have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current " edgy film - making " . maybe he just doesn ' t know any better . it ' s hard to tell . < br / > < br / > what ' s not hard to tell is the result . except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film - making into an attempt at pseudo - realism , few will enjoy it . < br / > < br / > i know i didn ' t . < br / > < br / > do yourselves a favor and pass on this film . 
NEG this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don ' t take it seriously . it is a bit dated and the effects are lame , but it is so enjoyable . there are giant crabs that attack a girl . oh , and the crabs sing japanese . it is amazingly bad . and the ending , which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome . predictable , but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat . don ' t even give this film a chance and you will love it . susan george is fun to watch and yes , she does appear naked . her daughter isn ' t quite worth putting up with , but she does get attacked by giant crabs . they are the size of large cats . this is a 2 , but i love it . as a movie , my god , but for entertainment , i give it a 7 . did i mention there are giant crabs ? 
NEG i ' ve seen the gator bait films , and this is almost exactly the same thing as those . a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them . the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones ( although not very far ) is that the sexual content is not glorified . there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film , but not for a second is it ever sexy . some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive , but that ' s only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience ' s need to see this woman seek revenge . < br / > < br / > this is a weak film , it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers . i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral , but i was glad to see that , since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead , it was not meant to pass off as a t & a film . < br / > < br / > b - movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality , and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b - movie and contains more than its share of nudity , the nudity does not drive the plot . on the other hand , the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists . these men are evolutionary drop - outs just like they were in the gator bait films , and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them , but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b - movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind , but instead it simply satisfies the audience ' s desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve . < br / > < br / > the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks . oddly , the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity ( although not by much ) , but it is by far the most painful to watch . we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible ( it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller , staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord ) , but again , this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with . < br / > < br / > ( spoilers ) you know that this is all the movie means to do , since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed . the woman does not live happily ever after , she doesn ' t write her book , she doesn ' t leave and never return to that nightmare place , she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks . but hey , what more did you expect ? < br / > < br / > oh , and did you read the tagline ? if you decide to waste your time watching this , try and find any man getting broken or burned . i was really looking forward to those 
NEG the fourth " tremors " feature goes back in time , to the year 1889 . " the legend begins " in the small city of " perfection " , which was then " rejection , nevada " . as the story begins , seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly " graboids " . some of the characters in the present - day " tremors " films have ancestors , both figurative and literal , in the past . most obvious is the ever - returning michael gross ( as hiram gummer ) . unlike his descendant , mr . gross is inept with firearms ; so , he hires gunslinger billy drago ( as " black hand " kelly ) to shoot ' em up some " dirt dragons " . < br / > < br / > this one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past . it ' s like a western with miniature versions of the original film ' s monster " graboids " . these tamer " dirt dragons " are nowhere near as terrorizing as their " tremors " ( 1990 ) counterparts . consequently , in this film , the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground , which would not have happened in the original movie . and , it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly , when gross temporarily decides to leave town . why so helpless ? why didn ' t brent roam ( as juan pedilla ) immediately rally the people to fight without gross ? disappointing . < br / > < br / > * * * * tremors 4 : the legend begins ( 2004 ) s . s . wilson ~ michael gross , brent roam , billy drago 
NEG this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the " seinfeld " show ! patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he ' s noticeably slimmer here . oliver reed got top billing but he ' s hardly in the film at all . warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him . eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they ' re is so much nudity in the film . if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they ' re turn with him . then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there ' s the bloody standoff . no real political message like the film " burn " but just another contrived plot device to move the story along . incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back ! i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad . the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton ' s lack of any accent make it at times laughable . very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel . 
NEG this is not a children ' s movie ! ! ! < br / > < br / > this movie is like a " bad acid trip " for kids under the age of 5 . for a month my 4 year old from time - to - time would ask me " why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth " or " why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits ? " . ( and that wasn ' t the worst of it ) . we stopped it about a 1 / 2 hour in but the damage had been done . intensely morbid , oppressive , violent . fortunately he ' s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing . whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges . . . . ( go ahead censure me , my conscience is clear . ) . 
NEG probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this : < br / > < br / > 1 . they might not have read the book . 2 . they might enjoy gore and violence in a film . 3 . they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence . 4 . people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book . 5 . there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here . < br / > < br / > the only thing i liked about this film is the song " ' bright eyes " . < br / > < br / > if perchance , you happen to be one of those people who has read the book , enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence , you are sure not to like this . otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this . < br / > < br / > like in the book , a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . only a few rabbits - including his brother hazel - believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live . . . 
NEG did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 + 2 ? god was behind everything ? what has god got to do with sci - fi ? god is only the answer when you can ' t think up a sensible explanation for something . in fact , this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn ' t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper , how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2 , why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head , why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head , etc . so they explain it with " angels " or just don ' t explain it at all . < br / > < br / > the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through . for example , why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl ( hera ) , particularly after adama said there was no way he ' d attempt a rescue ? because they found out the location of the cylon base ? that ' s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew ' s lives . and how did anders know the location ? and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters ' lives before the war ? it ' s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment . < br / > < br / > the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series . feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread ' the word ' . forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot , the important message the writers wanted to get across is : don ' t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction ; god is your ultimate salvation ( tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment ) . < br / > < br / > imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no " force " . . . instead , a jedi actually gets his power from jesus . then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks . would this be a good ending ? no it frakken ' wouldn ' t . 
NEG i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started " taking over " the plane . < br / > < br / > at first i thought maybe it should get a " one " for the comic relief . but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more ! < br / > < br / > whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed . and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are . when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun . the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay . and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that . < br / > < br / > this movie isn ' t worth a trip to blockbuster . be warned : if you pay for it , the only " victim " is your dumb ass . < br / > < br / > if you want to be really scared , i suggest the descent . if you want humor , go to your local stand up comedy club . their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash . 
NEG i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i , along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience , were vastly disappointed . the movie wasn ' t even so bad it was good ; it was as lifeless as a snake - bite victim . samual l . jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame . it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies , except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy . it all seemed worn , flat , and overtly formulaic . i ' m shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun . it ' s easy to understand that soap realizes it ' s a piece of s * it and plays along with it , but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense . it ' s the worst kind of lame movie : it ' s joyless . 
NEG this movie was the worst movie i have seen since " date movie . " i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared . it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example , the eye , the tongue , the butt , the breast . if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite . for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person . i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior . i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie . so i don ' t recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it . 
NEG i went into this film with expectations , from the hype , that it would be insightful and uplifting . certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band " wilco . " < br / > < br / > instead we get a lot of moping and whining about " the process , " a dishonorable and no doubt one - sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer / songwriter , a gut - wrenching confession by the fallen member ' s friend - - for like 18 years - - saying the " friendship had run its course , " and this whiny , uncompelling story about how one record label " hurt their feelings " by dumping them , only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels ( oh , the tension . . . not ! ) they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain , but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn ' t exist . this doesn ' t even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline , insight or even a decent job at cinematography . the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch . < br / > < br / > from the film , this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don ' t have and think they ' re some kind of guardians for the art of music , which they most definitely are not . and i thought the music sucked , and i couldn ' t even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer . < br / > < br / > i give it a 2 / 10 . 
NEG < br / > < br / > i would highly recommend seeing this movie . after viewing it , you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying " at least it wasn ' t the omega code . " < br / > < br / > forget my money , i want my time back ! 
NEG it has a great name , but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money , in fact the first 30 - 40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone . < br / > < br / > and yet the producers ( roberto angel salcedo ) calls him an actor , but i don ' t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting ! ! . . . . period . the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing . < br / > < br / > for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it , but they didn ' t ! ! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad , i don ' t buy it . < br / > < br / > but hopefully this is as bad as it gets . to make people accept those dvd ' s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it , that might work out . < br / > < br / > maka 
NEG i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight . it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer . the plot had potential ( who wouldn ' t love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets ? ) but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing . towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he ' s going to return , then a group of stars moves together to form an " elvis " constellation , which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators , sending them crashing through the roof . bad . . . really bad . which is the theme for the whole movie . i ' d avoid this one at all costs . 
NEG omg ! the only reason i ' m giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis - in - the - box . apart from that , how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie ? ? maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time . . . there are no laughs to mention , the stereotypes are pathetic , the cast is wasted , the direction is amateurish . now that i think about it , most of the blame probably lies with the director , joel zwick . he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved . don ' t waste your time like i did ; but then , i enjoy a good train wreck . geez , now the system is telling me i need more lines - - here ya go : this movie should be called return to sender . okay , now that was funnier than anything in the movie . . . 
NEG the plot was very thin , although the idea of naked , sexy , man eating sirens is a good one . < br / > < br / > the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie / splatter / lesbian mouth licking shots in between . < br / > < br / > the characters were wooden and one dimensional . < br / > < br / > the ending made no sense . < br / > < br / > considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it , you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects . some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them . < br / > < br / > brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush , naturally , and of course the lesbian moments . i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the ' shower scene ' < br / > < br / > the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely . < br / > < br / > if i had been watching this alone and aged 15 , i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes ( with 1 hand of the remote control ) , then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza . . . 
NEG for the first forty minutes , empire really shapes itself up : it appears to be a strong , confident , and relatively unknown gangster flick . at the time i didn ' t know why , i thought it was good - but now i do . < br / > < br / > one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful . i don ' t mind films with psychos and things , to prove a point - take jackie brown , for example - but they ' re all so terribly shallow in this , but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment . you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach . another major problem is the protagonist . he is smug , arrogant , yet - ironically enough - not that bad . he doesn ' t seem tight enough to be a drug - dealing woman killer . the fact is , at the end of the day , this film is completely pretentious . not slick , not clever , just dull , and meaningless - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs . < br / > < br / > * out of * * * * * ( 1 out of 5 ) 
NEG i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop ' s . and this one surely is an oop . one year after the exorcist she ' s back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out , she never became a mega star . that ' s one of the reason ' s many of her films are oop . she gives a good performance in this movie . it ' s about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn ' t have any friends . played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 , that ' s funny . the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity . in most editions it ' s cut out , why , i don ' t know , no blood is involved , okay , blair is butt naked but nothing is shown , no t & a so nothing to offend people . but the movie is slow , extremely slow . it doesn ' t happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep . it ' s just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows , no gore no nothing . why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me . if you ' re a fan of blair , buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is . 
NEG madison is not too bad -  if you like simplistic , non - offensive , " family - friendly " fare and , more importantly , if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing . if , like me , you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson , muncey , cantrell , slovak , etc . , prepare to be disappointed . < br / > < br / > professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book . i needn ' t repeat what they ' ve said . what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the " glory years " ( which many would argue were already past in 1971 ) . < br / > < br / > yes , it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast , though it was clear that the restored versions ( hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum ) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed . but where was the sound ? much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind - numbing roar of six allison or rolls - merlin aircraft engines , wound up to rpm ' s never imagined by their designers , hitting the starting line right in front of you . you didn ' t hear it , you felt it . real hydro buffs know exactly what i ' m talking about . there ' s none of that in madison . instead , every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a " heroic " musical score . < br / > < br / > and then there are the close - up shots of the drivers , riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines , in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home - town hero . or , in one particularly ridiculous shot , taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a " rocky " salute from a bridge pier . in reality , some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock - hard water at speeds above 150 mph . < br / > < br / > as one reviewer so aptly put it , " the sport deserves better than this . " < br / > < br / > finally , since another user brought up anachronisms , i ' ll add one : the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field . neither existed in 1971 
NEG the real shame of " the gathering " is not in the bad acting , nor is it in the despicably shallow plot . the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun , even though it did have one main attraction : takashima . i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova , even for just five minutes . she has that sarcasm , that wit , that double - edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable . sadly , though , the " babylon 5 " pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination . patricia tallman - - who never seriously returned to the series until much later - - fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander , who here is little more than a whiny , tiresome telepath . i shall leave you with one final thought - - why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer - space frog man ( even though she is a woman ) ? thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show . 
NEG i ' m sorry to say this , but the acting in this film is horrible . the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . perhaps i got the " dress rehearsal " version by mistake . the director over - uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . the story is pretty well written , and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films . the fights seem pretty real . but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point - blank automatic weapon fire , grenades , morter rounds , and bazookas . the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen , especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards , and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet . those bazookas need serious site calibration . 
NEG ok , so it was written in 1996 , before 9 / 11 , so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world , is prescient . that ' s it . that ' s the good stuff . the acting . . . fair . the plot . . . silly . the " twist " . . . unnecessary . dooooooooooom it isn ' t as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated . don ' t you think bureaucrats have a manual for " plagues " and how to contain them ? proper execution of such a plan is always a problem , as we saw after katrina . but they have a plan . it isn ' t to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania . and if the virus is carried in the air , why was the plane door open and the " shooters ' standing there with no protection ? in fact , did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs ? that would stop her . but not as dramatic . i ' m a sucker . i always watch a movie to see the end , once i started it . but this was a waste of time , and for the most part , predictable . i saw it using a recorder so i didn ' t have to watch all the ads , that was a plus . it ' s a good example of why i watch so little network tv . rubbish . 
NEG after seeing the low - budget shittier versions of the " universal soldier " franchise , i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie . well , it seemed this prayer was answered , but not the way i hoped . universial soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library . no , even that would be more intriguing . the fight sequences are top - notch , bruce lee quality , which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture . that and having former wcw tough - guy legend " goldberg " playing the villain . however , placing goldberg as seth ' s sidekick lieutenant would ' ve been better . < br / > < br / > we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself . it ' s like some film school students slapped it together . the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west ' s ego is what really did this movie in . for example : luc ' s daughter , hillary looks like she ' s at least 11 - 13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago . how is that possible ? tell me that ! the part in which luc ' s partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re - goddamn diculous ! you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie . c ' mon . the director could ' ve spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut . but oooh nooo ! < br / > < br / > speaking of the plot , it sucks ! compared to the first movie , universal soldier 2 ' s plot watered down and worthless . where ' s the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re - enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something ? this was the dawn of the millennium , you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia / orwellian type of future cesspit . corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad , sad , sad sequel . < br / > < br / > from what i seen : double impact , under siege 2 , robocop 3 , and hell , even the cheap - ass / no class terminator knock - off " class of 1999 " is more entertaining than this ! 
NEG the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims . on the surface , it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface , what lies is a not - so - positive message about rape . aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman . she needs a man to help her . when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her , she does not stand up for herself . it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying . < br / > < br / > the director ( satish kaushik ) went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive . what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way . the director is famous for being chauvinistic . his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles . he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial , it does not mean that the character herself is strong . < br / > < br / > the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya ' cleans ' herself after just being raped . she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty . though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light , what he does not show us is whether ash ' s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing . thus we are left with a confusing message about rape . < br / > < br / > the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this . even more so , the comedy is simply not funny . ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout . the music is mediocre except for the title track , which is beautifully picturised ( the only bright point of this film ) . sonali bendre ' s role is disappointing and pointless . overall , what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish - mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion . 
NEG in an otherwise good review , loleralacartelort7890 says " the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum - anti - radiation - alloy . it is not that well - known . and the exact specifications are a secret . and why is it a secret : well , why should they reveal it back then ? ? if they where in a space race with the russians , then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation . " this is completely incorrect . there is ( and was ) no " secret " to radiation protection in apollo . the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available . it uses a lightweight " honeycomb " of aluminum and stainless steel . the entire outer surface ( except the windows of course ) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin , thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re - entry . these materials are actually * better * at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space ( charged particles ) than lead , which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x - rays and gamma rays . < br / > < br / > space radiation is a definite problem for * long term * space flight because of the risk of big solar flares . but it simply wasn ' t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts . the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief ( 1 / 2 hour or so ) passage through the van allen belts . they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received : no more than 1 . 5 rem , and usually much less . of the 24 men who flew to the moon ( 12 of whom landed ) , 18 are still alive . only two have died from cancer : alan shepard ( leukemia ) and jack swigert ( bone cancer ) . the rest died from heart attacks , pancreatitis ( roosa ) , and a motorcycle accident ( conrad ) . these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s ( shepard would be 86 ) . 
NEG i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations ; basically because of kamal hassan . he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever . but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen . after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better . < br / > < br / > the protagonist , raghavan , is a very daring police officer . who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders . raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers , two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students , behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree . finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives . < br / > < br / > these two psycho - killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters . the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly , which the movie could have survived without . < br / > < br / > to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty . the director , gautham , should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience . certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham ' s name on the production list . 
NEG about three minutes into this thing i started fast - forwarding , pausing only during the nudity ( why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women ? ) . in ten minutes i was done , and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store . the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa . come on writers - the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy ' s remote control ! that ' s the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire ! also , to add insult to injury , the " twist " at the end was so formulaic , that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years . burt reynolds was fine , but he should concentrate on real movies . < br / > < br / > this movie is just a waste of time - run away ! run away ! 
NEG so i ' m looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called ' end game ' . it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller . well worth a look then . or so i thought . < br / > < br / > boy , was i wrong . < br / > < br / > end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring . now being something of a whodunnit , i can ' t really tear into it as i would like without ' ruining ' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity . but questions such as ' why has he / she / they done this ? ' , and ' where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ? ' are all too abundant following the film ' s unintentionally hilarious conclusion . < br / > < br / > as for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor ' s realised that they ' ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie , and this then shows in their performance ? this is one of those . accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed , irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison . < br / > < br / > of course , this didn ' t make it to the cinema , and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room ; it is appalling . 
NEG the minion is about . . . well , a minion . a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped . he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another . anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage . dolph lundgren plays lukas , a member of a secret order of templars , who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion . the movie begins a thousand years ago , in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion . then flash forward to 1999 , where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york . an archeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found . needless to say , the minion is after the key , and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist . < br / > < br / > the movie , is just that , a low budget b - movie flick . the movie lacks energy , and just trods along . you ' ll follow the chase but you won ' t ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies ( especially the terminator films ) . the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome , in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is . it " skillfully " becomes a one - man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one - on one . and it ' s supposed to be around for a long time . all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience . the whole idea of a secret order of templars , a door to hell , and the key isn ' t well explained . we are merely to accept that they just exist . the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there ' s not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks . dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else . < br / > < br / > the verdict : 2 of 5 stars . 
NEG for two of the funniest comedians , the movie was awful . fast forwarded it and never got any better ! waste of time and waste of money ! tina fey is such a great writer , i thought that she would be so great in the comedy . the previews were so great , but they only showed the best parts of the movie . my husband even thought that for a chick flick , it sucked . what is up with that . movie was very slow ans boring . i will not recommend it to anyone at this time . i would like my money back for this one ! boo from us here in arizona . thanks but no thanks . who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant . i thought that it was going to be so funny , i have had my own children and i have helped others have children . it could have been more along the lines of reality . 
NEG what a stinkeroo this turned out to be ! ! ! at one time , much earlier in her career , linda darnell was one of my favorites - no great shakes as an actress , but very beautiful and pleasant ( particularly in films like " the mark of zorro " and " blood and sand " ) but when i saw this monstrosity , the memories of her golden days faded quickly . the story is unbelievable and farcical , the acting second - rate , the supporting cast insufferable . i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter , and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked . added to this , was the terrible photography ( and i am not just referring to the color ! ) everyone associated with this , must have shuddered whenever it was shown . 
NEG shame on julia roberts and john cusack . they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie . the storyline was dumb and predictable . the jokes were not funny . the romance was not really romance . i was all too happy when this movie ended . 
NEG would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball . this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level . in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp . he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra . this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world , the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it . 
NEG as a " jane eyre " fan i was excited when this movie came out . " at last , " i thought , " someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author . " wrong ! ! ! if the casting director was intending to cast a " jane " who was plain he certainly succeeded . however , surely he could have found one who could also act . where was the tension between jane and rochester ? where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere ? where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother ? finally , why was the plot changed at the end ? one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book . what a disappointment 
NEG oh just what i needed , another movie about 19th century england . which is pretty much like regular england , only nobody ' s vandalising football stadiums . in this picturesque setting of lords , dames and other randomly chosen titles , charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre , from that novel nobody has ever read willingly . jane usually hangs out in mr . rochester ' s crib , where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time . one day , mr . rochester ( william hurt on auto - pilot ) comes back to fall in love with jane and all that , but there ' s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic . oops , that wasn ' t in the brochure . after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire ( they probably rented the set ) , the movie finally comes to an end . everything looked really authentic , that ' s something i guess . but then again , nah . 
NEG having read the novel before seeing this film , i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot . i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte ' s work , and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story . in the condensing of the film to a short 2hours , the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional , thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding . there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre , so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their ' love ' is superficial . this is such an injustice to bronte ' s novel ; you are given no impression of jane ' s quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her , and his arrogance which attracts jane to him . < br / > < br / > despite to poor scripting , i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely , namely mrs fairfax and grace poole , however overall the production was poor . given a better scripting , perhaps the film would have been more successful . see " jane eyre " ( 1970 ) with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production . 
NEG this ambitious film suffers most from writer / director paul thomas anderson ' s delusions of grandeur . highly derivative of much better material ( altman ' s " nashville , " lumet ' s " network " ) , this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere . a couple of misguided detours along the way ( an embarrassing musical interlude , a biblical plague ) don ' t help matters . neither does the uneven level of performances . especially bad : william h . macy , whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether ; julianne moore , for her unconvincing angst . and how many times must we see john c . reilly ' s sad sack shtick ( " chicago " and " the hours " will suffice ) ? tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist , foul - mouthed holy roller was rather amusing . speaking of foul mouths , the script was so loaded with " f " bombs , they lost their impact in no time . don ' t even talk about that awful soundtrack , full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann . her extended rendition of " one , " a maudlin number to begin with , drove me to distraction at the start of the film . i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours , by which time i ' d been pushed to the brink of hell . one redeeming feature , which i haven ' t seen mentioned in other reviews , is the best performance in the bunch , by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia , the damaged coke fiend bent on self - destruction . her credibility exceeded all others by far . this film took itself way too seriously and just didn ' t know when to end . 
NEG i can ' t tell you how angry i was after seing this movie . the characters are not the slightest bit interesting , and the plot is non - existant . so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other , hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish , what do we get ? ? ? a storm of frogs . now yes , i understand the references to the bible ( exodus ) and the underlying theme , but first of all , it was presented with absolutely no resolution , and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible ( a significant portion of the population ) or charles fort ( a still larger portion ) . as a somewhat well read person , i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode . < br / > < br / > don ' t waste your time . it would be better spent reading . . . < br / > < br / > . . . well anything to be honest 
NEG this movie was made for fans of dani ( and cradle of filth ) . i am not one of them . i think he ' s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon ( still , i ' m generally not a fan of black metal ) . but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it , i convinced myself , that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing . thus i assumed i ' m in for a roller - coaster ride of rubber gore and do - it - yourself splatter with a sinister background . now , that is what i do like . < br / > < br / > i got home and popped it in . my patience lasted 15 minutes . awful camera work and disgusting quality . and that was then ( 2002 ) , that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder . i left it on the shelf . maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this . . . picture . < br / > < br / > after a couple of months i got back to it ( in mentioned surroundings ) and saw half . then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me . my disliking evolved . i noticed how funny dani ( 1 , 65m ; 5 ' 5 " height ) looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart . ( yes , ripping . his head apparently had no skull . ) i also found that this movie may have no sense . still , i haven ' t finished it yet , so i wasn ' t positive . < br / > < br / > after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back . . . ( yes , it took me 5 , 5 years . ) so - dani in fact was funny as satan / manson / super - evil - man ' s helper and the movie did not make sense . see our bad person employs dani to do bad things . he delivers . why ? well i guess he ' s just very , very bad . as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it . < br / > < br / > we have a couple of short stories joined by dani ' s character . my favourite was about a guy , who steals someone ' s leg , because he wants to use it as his own . yeah , exactly . < br / > < br / > the acting ' s rock bottom . the cgi is the worst ever . i mean stinger beats it ( and , boy , is stinger ' s cgi baaaaad ) . the story has no sense . and the quality is . . . let ' s just say it is not satisfying . the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore . blood and guts are made pretty well . why , you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on . ( example - dani ' the man ' filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it . . . and then eats what fell out . why ? we never know . we do know , however , that this cat must have been on illegal substances , as his heart is almost half his size . ) < br / > < br / > you might think , after my comment that this movie is so bad it ' s good , but it ' s just bad . cradle of filth fans can add 3 points . i added one for gore . 
NEG i love the munna bhai mbbs but " lagge raho . . . " sux really sux . i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life . and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers ? ? < br / > < br / > * * may be spoiler * * < br / > < br / > an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai , people discussing their personal prob . on phones come on man from which part of the world u r ? ? ? i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible . < br / > < br / > 2 out of 10 . ( 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting ) 
NEG this is a film that makes you say 2 things . . . 1 ) i can do much better than this ( acting , writing and directing ) 2 ) this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others . . . < br / > < br / > looks as if it was shot with my flip video . i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me . i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video ; must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film . one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen . hopefully the writers and director leave the business . not even talented enough to do commercials ! ! ! ! ! 
NEG this film is so much of a rip - off of the masterpeice " demons " and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching . the acting is terrible , the action scenes are speeded up , the script is almost painful and budget non existent . < br / > < br / > if you think this film is good then you havn ' t seen a real horror film , skip this and get a copy of the movie demons . 
NEG lame , lame , lame ! ! ! a 90 - minute cringe - fest that ' s 89 minutes too long . a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility ( an abandoned convent ) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky , witless dialogue that ' s straining oh - so - hard to be hip . mostly it ' s just embarrassing , and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat ( a sample of this movie ' s dialogue : after demonstrating her artillery , fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau ' s vigilante character she : ` any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck ) . bad acting , idiotic , homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects , it looks like the director ' s watched ` the evil dead ' way too many times . < br / > < br / > i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they ' ll never get back . what a turd . 
NEG this movie is awful ! i don ' t even know where to begin , i ' m speechless i can ' t even describe how awful this is . the blood is flourescent first of all , and the acting is awful ! the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day . this movie was rediculous , i don ' t see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad . it looks like it was made by highschool students . 
NEG manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa , parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs < br / > < br / > this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe < br / > < br / > the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid < br / > < br / > the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life , the masks of amitabh haha and more < br / > < br / > direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay < br / > < br / > amitabh does his part with style , nothing different from coolie , laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual , nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual 
NEG first , let ' s all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor , barely even decent , sometimes just plain lousy . however , in this piece of @ * ! ^ called snakeeater , the film industry as a whole sank . < br / > < br / > first , let ' s start with the plot . a vietnam vet named jack kelly , aka soldier ( who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some , which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys ' feet and pins them to the floor ) , gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped . therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister . had some potential , but still pretty thin to begin with . < br / > < br / > now , the acting . being an actor myself , i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art ! ! ! ! ! lamas is , well , himself . the jackasses playing the clampets / deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so - called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere , especially talented ones who never get their big break ! < br / > < br / > finally , the action . the gunfighting is so - so at best , and the fist - fighting is deplorable . i ' ve seen more real - looking fights at the renaissance festival ( and those were pretty fake - looking ) ! < br / > < br / > readers , listen to me : avoid this piece of caca at all costs ! if it were the only film in existence , you still would want to avoid it ! for the sake of your brain - cell count , do not watch this thing ! 
NEG first of all , i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes ( cause of the bas screenplay ) . i don ' t think this movie has any purpose . it ' s boring from the first minute to the last . i don ' t understand why this movie scores so high . i gave it 1 / 10 but actually it ' s not more wurth then 0 / 10 . 
NEG i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input . i know they ' re going for realism , but to be frank i just don ' t want realism . realism is boring . if i want to see daily life , i ' ll uhm , live . tell me an interesting story and we ' ll talk . i can deal with the low production values , hell i ' m a sucker for low production values , but at least work in some good ideas . the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit , but obviously i ' m supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic . hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out . i can only conclude this is not drama , not by a long shot . we get to see rosetta walking to someplace , rosetta working in a bakery , rosetta eating a waffle , rosetta carrying around bags of far , rosetta walking back home , rosetta walking someplace . . . it ' s just not that entertaining . there isn ' t really a deeper meaning either . i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it ' s just plain realism , the most overrated quality in the business . i guess i ' m supposed to love this , but come on , there ' s nothing in there . 
NEG having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 , i came here to pan it - - but after reading the other comments , i haven ' t the heart . clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age . well , let me not be a complete grinch ; it might still work for some children - - if they are not too media - saturated and have not become visually over - sophisticated , e . g . from watching all of lotr and harry potter . but if you are an adult , stay miles away ; you will not enjoy it . < br / > < br / > the good bits : barbara kellerman as the witch , especially in her early scenes with edmund , creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness . ( at the stone table she goes a bit over the top . ) michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s . perry as mr . tumnus also have the kind of polished , skillful acting we ' d expect from the very best bbc dramas . and the aslan costume works very well , amazingly well considering . they got the eyes just right . < br / > < br / > the bad bits : almost everything else , but two areas in particular . one , the casting . england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids . how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs ? they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well . peter has no gravitas or charisma ( and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings ) ; edmund is just whiny ; and lucy . . . sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically , visibly , drastically wrong for this part that i can ' t imagine how she got the job . < br / > < br / > two , the animal costumes . again , it appears that they worked for some kids . if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting , believable characters , they might be entranced by this film . but to a viewer with the sophistication of , say , a 12 - year - old who ' s seen prisoner of azkaban ? when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree , there will be hoots of cruel , derisive laughter . the costumes just do not work - - i could not , and i think any adult or modern teen could not , suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver . the drawn animation later ( gryphons , etc . ) works better , is easier to take . < br / > < br / > so : ten stars for the very young and tender of soul ; everyone else read , or re - read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination . 
NEG i ' m a fan of the series and have read all 7 books . i wanted to see this just to see how it was done . all i can say , is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it . its pretty bad , and will turn you off reading them . not to be mean , but lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie . was she the directors daughter ? seriously , i ' m sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth . she had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame . the movie just loses so much in translation . cs books don ' t translate as easily as the tolkein lotr books , or even harry potter . < br / > < br / > one thing they did right ! aslan ! very well done . although the other human actors with painted faces ( beavers , wolf ) look silly , aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around . ( i guess its like that old horse custume ? 2 people inside ? ) also , i would be curious what kids think of this movie . maybe they would enjoy it ? but as for adults , safe bet they wont , even if a cs fan . 
NEG while some scenes of training were realistic , too many of them depicted military instructors as ex - nazi types . obviously , the people who wrote the screen play were either anti - military types or writing a film for that audience . < br / > < br / > i am a viet nam vet and , even during this period , military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison . < br / > < br / > and i really loved the scene where the " hero " and his buddy ( both privates ) are sitting down in the captain ' s office , smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy . this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation , as was the purpose for the scene . < br / > < br / > at the end i asked myself , " what was this film about ? " as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except " i hate all authority . " thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it . 
NEG if i had never read the book , i would have said it was a good movie . but i did read the book . who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline . there is so many changes , that it wasn ' t really worthy of the title . character changes , plot changes , time line changes . . . < br / > < br / > first off who was henry and the investigator ? they weren ' t in the story . henry had mitch ' s persona somewhat , but mitch wasn ' t a cop . no you made it so roz , helped ' sink ' his body and used that as zenia ' s blackmail against roz . the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him . her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother . her son wasn ' t even really mentioned in the story . neither i don ' t believe was his lover , roz ' s secretary . < br / > < br / > tony and west were not together in the beginning . he was actually with zenia first while in college . the black painted apartment was their idea , tony just went to visit . this is where zenia and tony meet , become fast friends . tony hides her love for west . then zenia left west , with cash from tony , then west and tony get together . eventually marry , at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time . only to be heart broken again . then go back to tony . zenia ' s blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia . now being a professor at college she didn ' t want to let it get out . i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully . < br / > < br / > charis character was a blond , not that it really matters . zenia didn ' t trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive . no she was there when charis had a lover named billy . augusta ' s father , he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war . eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal . zenia and billy have an affair right under charis ' s nose while taking care of them both . then zenia turns in billy to the government , and leaves on the ferry with him . not with augusta , charis was pregnant with her tho . charis also had a split personality , karen was her real name . < br / > < br / > zenia did not die from being cut up into piece ' s . . . . she fell or was possibly pushed ( we never really knew ) off the balcony and landed in a fountain . she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od ' d . she was also really dieing of cancer this time around . < br / > < br / > it didn ' t show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader . the book was striped down to its bare bones . then re made in someone else ' s vision . why couldn ' t you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie . it was different enough , and i ' m sure could have been made more so . 
NEG sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one . you can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back . i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension . . . why . . . . he lent his name to this vermin . 
NEG hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward . < br / > < br / > it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten . there ' s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops , and habits in a church tower like quasimodo ( only he is much less sympathetic ) . < br / > < br / > there ' s a strange love story involved which doesn ' t have anything to do with anything . she happens to look like his mother , yes so what ? we know he misses his mother , that ' s what the first ten minutes were about . they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o . k . short film . now it ' s a portrait of a character who doesn ' t change . he is a guy that stuff happens to . the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job . < br / > < br / > there ' s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character . he paints his face , dresses in women ' s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head . a badger ! you ' ve got to see the ending ! he returns to his home with the badger on his head ( and it is shot like a tacky horror film ) to kill his dad ' s new wife ( which he had sex with in the beginning ) . and somehow they thought this wouldn ' t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background . i ' ve got to admit though , i ' m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose . it feels like this mackenzie director / guy / whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school . you are so smart ! thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories ! you really dug ! what a wallraff ! okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book , but anyway . . < br / > < br / > photowise it is boring . a lot of talking heads . plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene , you know cold and warm etc . . why ? maybe " hallam foe " is both a feature and a test film for color blind people . or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn ' t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely , so they increased blue so that we really get it . < br / > < br / > i ' m not even gonna comment on the cliché indie - oh - how - how - how - cute drawings they have made in the presentation . and all the " cute " sex stuff going on . this whole film is an independent cliché . but i do recommend it . i laughed more than a few times . though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine . 
NEG i was so disappointed in this movie . i don ' t know much about the true story , so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history . with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination . well , somewhere the screenplay failed them . it was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood ? his love life ? his own disability ? his speaking ability ? his passion for the disabled ? i ' m sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story , but this movie wasn ' t it . i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities , but because of their personalities . other small gripes : 1 . the heavy - handed soundtrack . it ' s the seventies - we get it already ! 2 . if he ' s such a phenomenal public speaker , why weren ' t we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages ? 
NEG what about dahmer ' s childhood ? - the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body ? what about " infinity land " ? - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another , suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger . what about the relationship between his parents , and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father ? his feelings of neglect when his brother was born ? what about his fascination with insects and animals ? how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home ? what about focusing more on his cannibalism ? and what about his parent ' s divorce ? these are all things that should have been included in the film . instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down ' snapshot ' from a night or two in his life , and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks , to events that weren ' t even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer . < br / > < br / > why didn ' t the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people ? he could have made this point many times , particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them ( which actually took place in a health club , not a night club ) . instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind . < br / > < br / > whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes ( or however long ) , but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet ? ( known as rodney in this film ) . my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet ' s character , to try and make us fear for or empathise with him , but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer , so why couldn ' t he have spend those forty five minutes on something else ? if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough , but it wasn ' t . the scene in which he kills steven hicks , his first victim , is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing , and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life . unfortunately the film doesn ' t explain that it was his first killing , or that he didn ' t kill again for nine years . we assume , because his hair style is different , and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback , but to when ? and why ? < br / > < br / > what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career ? - one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations . . < br / > < br / > some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal , but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth , it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed . why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued ? < br / > < br / > finally , a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate , not a 15 . we needed to see his perversion in more depth , to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us . that doesn ' t mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone ' s head for instance , but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed , and what his modus operandi was when actually killing . anyone watching this film who doesn ' t know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people . he actually killed seventeen men . < br / > < br / > aside from the facts and lack of depth , the film isn ' t all bad . there is some nice cinematography , and good performances from the two main characters . i ' d like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge , more energy , and a better reason for making the film in the first place . 
NEG the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used . if ms . pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer . < br / > < br / > otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies . as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value , which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get . perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to " de - commercialize " their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing . . . . 
NEG i know it ' s a power - rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie ? if they are going to write a plot with crayons , at least have the decency to make it silly . it ' s kind of hilarious if you watch this . we have a typical family filled with cliched characters ( father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol ) , air - head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting , and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space . funny stuff ! < br / > < br / > however , the real great moment comes near the end when war - dad and bad - acting - villain try to work a sword fight , but then they realize none of them know how to ( probably because no room in budget for choreographers ) , so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in . lol . < br / > < br / > 1 / 10 rating because they try to treat this seriously . 
NEG the main problem with the documentary " czech dream " is that isn ' t really saying what it thinks it ' s saying . < br / > < br / > in an audacious - i hesitate to use the word " inspired " - act of street theater , vit klusak and filip remunda , two student filmmakers from the czech republic , pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie : they deliberately fabricated a phony " hypermarket " ( the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store ) , built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards , radio and tv spots , an official logo , a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many " dopes " would show up to their creation on opening day . they even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed . < br / > < br / > one might well ask , " why do such a thing ? " well , that ' s a very good question , but the answer the filmmakers provide isn ' t all that satisfying a one . essentially , we ' re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something that ' s not true - simply through the power of advertising . and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the " real " ( i . e . higher ) purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union . fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers , all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of " research " into what does and does not work in advertising . in a way , by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments , these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse . < br / > < br / > but , in many ways , the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target , it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it . for it is they themselves and not the good - hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here , as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people , some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot . and what is all this supposed to prove anyway ? that people are " greedy " because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains ? or that they ' re stupid and gullible because they don ' t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised ? such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world . < br / > < br / > no , i ' m afraid this smart - alecky , nasty little " stunt " only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots . and , indeed many of them , when they finally discover the trick that ' s been played on them , react with a graciousness and good humor i ' m not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position . < br / > < br / > i ' m not saying that the movie isn ' t gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but , when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red - faced and empty - handed to their homes , we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed . 
NEG where to start . the film started out pretty well , but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock . the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in . it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by . < br / > < br / > the actors gave an average performance in this movie however , i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film . < br / > < br / > as the film dragged on , and take my word for it , it dragged on , it just got more and more far fetched . < br / > < br / > * * * spoiler alert * * * spoiler alert * * * spoiler alert * * * just when i thought the film could not get any worse , towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up , just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all . it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end . the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was . once the lead role disposes of vinny jones , he becomes the new killer . < br / > < br / > in closing , this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made . i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie ! ! 
NEG this is only the second time i ' ve felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film . the first time was for probably the best movie i ' ve ever seen and that was for memento . < br / > < br / > seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento , as in the worst film i ' ve had the misfortune to see . apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash - pile that it is . < br / > < br / > let ' s see , apalling effects , cliched script , bad acting and about 90 minutes too long . my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad . amazingly i watched it to the end , how i did that i don ' t know ! avoid ! ! ! 
NEG hi , i ' m a friend of werewolf movies , and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like " hmm , simple and nice name to it at least . althou . . . i wonder why i haven ' t heard of it before . " < br / > < br / > first of all , the movie starts with tits . lots of tits . tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to . who cares about a werewolf effect , just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots ! < br / > < br / > so , about the mysterious darkwolf character ( a little spoilers ahead , but who really cares . . . ) he ' s your average everyday biker . not even super - tough looking , but like the old wise woman says in the movie " he is far more powerful and dangerous than you ' ve ever faced before . " just by describing her a tattooed biker - type of a guy . pretty original . i even had look twice when they first used the " red glowing eyes " special effect ! i mean my god , that " lets - plant - red - dots - on - eyes - with - computer " effect has been used since the seventies . it looks plain ugly here ! and don ' t get me started with the werewolf 3d - cgi . as said before , like an bad and old video game . < br / > < br / > and finally , as i do like werewolf films , like i said . they prettymuch always build a werewolf - legend of their own . darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well , about some silly legends of hybrid - werewolves and the ancient bloodline . but . it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement " the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched " starts random - slashing . which just doesn ' t make any sense , why even bother telling us the rules of killing , when they aren ' t even gonna play by them . . . aplus the wolf - point - of - view shots are made with a sony handycam or something , filming mostly the floor and walls . just add growling noises and you ' ve got a super werewolf effect . the gore is partially ok . but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand , just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims , it just doesn ' t do the trick for me . . . < br / > < br / > truly , who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight - to - video horrortitles , they aren ' t even funny - kind of bad movies , just sad . 
NEG i watched this film alone , in the dark , and it was full moon outside ! i didn ' t do it in purpose , it just happened in this way . so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me ! ! well , it didn ' t , in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only 8 minutes , but i thought come on give it a chance , unfortunately i did . the acting was awful , the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong . the plot is not original , if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before . some scenes didn ' t make sense at all , and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer ! the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie . the ( scary ) scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology , yet some good movies were made back then ! i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie , i thought couldn ' t they put some money in this and make it decent ? ! ! i couldn ' t agree more with the ratings that the movie got , it is also my rating for it , 3 out of 10 . 
NEG darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie ( samaire armstrong ) who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary ( tippi hedren ) is killed by a werewolf , you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley ( ryan olosio ) who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself & that a so - called ' dark prince ' werewolf ( kane hodder ) wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world , or something like that . understandably josie has a hard time believing it , that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes . it ' s up to werewolf cop steve to save josie , the day & the world . . . < br / > < br / > co - executive produced & directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn ' t really do anything for me . the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there ' s a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it ' s pretty much down hill all the way i ' m afraid . for a start it ' s slow going , it ' s dull , it ' s predictable & it ' s populated with highly annoying character ' s who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don ' t , i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead . the script is dumb & doesn ' t explain itself , why has josie never turned into a werewolf before ? is she really the only one ? why can ' t this ' dark prince ' find another female werewolf ? there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half - way through but you get the idea anyway , as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least . < br / > < br / > director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn ' t really improve the film as a spectacle . now let ' s talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special , the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi & it ' s among the worst looking cgi i ' ve ever seen , seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics . it ' s easily the worst werewolf transformation i ' ve ever seen , an american werewolf in london ( 1981 ) was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light - years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf , who says special effects have improved over the years ? the animatronic puppet effects aren ' t much better either although at least there ' s something psychical on screen . the gore isn ' t up to much after a gory opening kill there ' s some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else . thre ' s a fair amount of female nudity if that ' s your thing but don ' t get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it , is it really worth it ? < br / > < br / > technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever , it ' s reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values . the acting is what you ' d expect really . < br / > < br / > darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations , i didn ' t think it was as bad as some but it ' s like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they ' re both horrible still . . . 
NEG dark wolf ( quick review ) let ' s get right to it : this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh * t on it . it ' s just an awful movie . it ' s an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80 ' s high school drama film . what ' s worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf . kane f * cking hodder . someone ' s trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career . . . < br / > < br / > anyway , former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf , too . it ' s kind of a crappy cop drama with the world ' s worst looking werewolf in it . but it does have moments of near - rampant nudity . but that ' s about all . want to know more ? okay , the werewolf is generally an ugly - looking black blur zipping around the screen . and when we ' re privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence , we ' re presented with something that resembles a full - motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation . the first playstation . the cg animation is really that primitive . only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit . 2 / 10 < br / > < br / > www . residenthazard . com 
NEG 2002 ' s undeservedly popular " i love the 80 ' s " is an inane , idiotic , offensive and downright disgusting pop - culture mess of a show that was the first in a long - line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 , which was at one time the only real music - oriented channel left on tv ! i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter , i forget which one now , of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever . out of sheer morbid curiosity ( i ' d guess that ' s what you ' d call it ) i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look - see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap . at least i can honestly say that i wasn ' t a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement - level to begin with . the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980 ' s and what was and wasn ' t culturally significant or popular ( which is what i was expecting to see ) , but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god - awful no - name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills * rolls eyes * . . . more like lack - thereof if you ask me ! it ' s pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so - called " humor " that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one - liner they shot off one after another ! altogether , i have no problem in saying that " i love the 80 ' s " was / is trash of the lowest denominator , and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore . 
NEG this really is the worst film i have ever seen . ever . period . i actually paid £ 3 . 50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie . incredibly dull , poorly acted , dire script , often incoherent and too many scenes that don ' t seem to have any relevance to the overall film ( like when heath ledger ' s priest partner get ' s nailed to a wall by a ghost . . . what was the point in that scene ? answers on a postcard please . . . ) < br / > < br / > i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it ' s entire running time . i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again . < br / > < br / > this should be cast into imdb ' s bottom 100 . hopefully my vote of 1 / 10 will help it on it ' s way . 
NEG : : potential spoilers : : < br / > < br / > man , this movie was awful . a catholic / superstitious / suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies . < br / > < br / > the doubting priest . sex and the priesthood . politics and religion . church hypocrisy . conspiracy involving the church . the dawn of a new evil age . all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil . < br / > < br / > pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice . the story revolves around two concepts : absolution , better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick - the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one ' s sins while on the brink of death ; and excommunication , the act of cutting a person off from the church . basically , an excommunicated person can ' t receive absolution . thus comes in the sin eater , and i ' ll leave it at that . throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have " the order " . < br / > < br / > i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics . it also ends with heath ledger saying ( i paraphrase ) " i am the redeemer and damner of sins , i live on without love blah blah blah " / cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla " the matrix " . < br / > < br / > i gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process . if you want to see something better i suggest " the prophecy " with christopher walken . 
NEG ok . . . i watch a lot of bad movies . i pride myself on that fact . many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs . but this movie is one of the worst i have watched . i like a good horror movie . . . but one with a plot of and sense of movement . the opening scenes seemed pretty good . decent music and imagery . then it goes down hill from there . one of the main characters has a disability ( ringing in the ears called tinnitus ) . now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret . they made that too much of a focus of the movie . so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn ' t have been . no need to keep bringing it up . so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table . so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body . now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her . well after seeing her sister over and over again ( as a zombie like ghost ) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her . now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her . bad thing is that she didn ' t have much of a plan . only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped . the idiot didn ' t even believe he killed her . so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun . . . . somehow she manages to get herself strangled . so the last scenes of the movie are of the " spirits " of her and her twin walking out of the water . so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins . and not one but two innocent people die . < br / > < br / > good things about the movie : imagery < br / > < br / > bad things about the movie : music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors 
NEG for a film with so much promise it was disappointing , thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable . the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it ' s the worst clichéd ending i ' ve seen in a movie for some time . the final scene would have ripped my heart out , if the entire movie hadn ' t been so painful to begin with . i was numb ! from the very first scene - one was left wondering , if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help , or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i ' ve seen to date . it was a horror in the true sense of the word . 
NEG as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie . but , what a disappointment ! although the acting and the production values aren ' t bad , the script is awful , the plot is unrealistic , and the theme is disturbing . < br / > < br / > the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children . i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it ' s view of women . has the writer been living under a rock ? < br / > < br / > although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen , i wouldn ' t suggest this movie to anyone . it ' s terrible . it ' s an embarrassment to the city it ' s named after . 
NEG i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film . nearly every review of this movie had been positive , the effects looked enticing , the previews convincing . < br / > < br / > needless to say , disappointment actually doesn ' t describe the feeling i got from this film . it was rage . < br / > < br / > beyond being boring and poorly written , the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source . i understand the difference between an homage and stealing : this was stealing . more importantly , it seems that the filmmakers didn ' t steal to progress a point or move the plot along . they stole just to show that they could . there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene ( that i won ' t elaborate on ) which steals from the same film . needless to say , every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept : it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen , from pulp - era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film " the iron giant " , to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films , most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in " star wars : the phantom menace " . < br / > < br / > on the subject of the actual film , most of the performances were completely wooden . perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue - screen , with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors . frankly , this is no excuse for poor acting . if a person was ever a child , they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying . < br / > < br / > finally , there is no humanity in this film . the protagonists are the only real human beings here . nearly all the antagonists are robots , and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand . if robots are attacking the entire planet , shouldn ' t we expect to see masses of humanity running from them ? the sub - par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to , really , anything here . < br / > < br / > the film wasn ' t the worst movie out there , which is why i didn ' t give it a 1 . rather , the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films : the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects , but without artistic vision or originality of any kind , it falls flat . 
NEG i ' ve said this in other reviews , without a story , you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want , still no one will give a damn . < br / > < br / > the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco ( which i love ) , and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making . however , it ' s obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie , he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned - plotted film . ( spoiler ) for crying out loud , they forgot to have a villain in this thing ! ok they have one , but he ' s been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place . conran misses the point of having a villain . as far as action goes , well let ' s see , sky captain ( law ) shoots down one robot , two or three of the flapping wing airplanes ( before dex ( ribisi ) tells him to stop shooting them down ! ! ! ) , and a couple robots , but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him . paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie ( the reviewer who comments on hers and law ' s lack of chemistry is so right ) and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera , showing she only has two shots left , both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie , one uncomically , one quite funny , although i saw it coming from 70 years away . no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen , and that ' s the movie ' s real flaw . an audience doesn ' t identify with robots , they need a hero to root for , and a visible , despicable villain to hate . without that , plus a good engaging story , all the cg in the world won ' t help . 
NEG okay . so there aren ' t really that many great movies around . recent gems like american dream , the straight story and even toy story 2 don ' t normally come so close together . but boy ( ! ) does this film counter - balance the quality . < br / > < br / > i have no idea what these people thought they were doing . are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of * * * * ? i can just see it now . . . < br / > < br / > producer - " so we ' ve got joe fiennes . he ' s cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love . and we ' ve got rhys ifans , who isn ' t cute but was cool in notting hill . we ' ll mix in a really mediocre score , a few forgettable post - britpop tunes , hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you ' ve got the worst film of the new millennium . and believe me , it ' s gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years . " < br / > < br / > the bank - " i like it ! any unnecessary sex ? bad camera movements ? and what about the worst accents this side of devil ' s own ? " < br / > < br / > producer - " yeah , we got plenty of those . " < br / > < br / > the bank - " sounds great , where do we sign ? " < br / > < br / > please . 
NEG boring and appallingly acted ( summer pheonix ) . she sounded more asian than jewish . some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century . what on earth fine actors like ian holm & anton lesser were doing in this is beyond me . 
NEG there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn ' t help with the major downsides to the movie . i never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can ' t convince . fiennes just can ' t do irish and fitzgerald isn ' t much better at russian . when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing . as the for the major problem . . . . the plot . . . . was there one ? i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn ' t wait for the film to end . . . it was ridiculous . save 90 minutes of your life and don ' t watch this movie ! 
NEG i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film . . . . the road side bar scene in russia . in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - " 50 dollars . . you drink and talk " , but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could , so i declined to take this speaking part on . i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience . . . . and who knows . . . these lines could have ended up there with lines such as " i ' ll be back " and " quite frankly my dear , i don ' t give a damn " . had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as ' heavy 1 ' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski . < br / > < br / > as time goes on , i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film . < br / > < br / > even though i spent a whole day on the set , in south wales hot - spot barry island , no one could tell me what the actual storyline was . the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it . . . . . things could certainly have been worse if i ' d ended up naked in this most dreadful of films . . . . < br / > < br / > still . . . . . on the positive side . . . . i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break . i had no idea who he was , as " notting hill " was yet to be released , and not an inkling that he might be welsh . made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s . it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production . . . . . . . . 
NEG back ( again ) in scotland , lassie is ( again ) on trial for her life . because the faithful dog sleeps on her master ' s grave , she must be put to death , according to law . oddly , it is also explained that lassie had no " legal " owner , which is , apparently , also against an old scottish law . if , after three days , no owner is located , dogs must be destroyed . edmund gwenn ( as john traill ) pleads lassie ' s case , which leads to an extended flashback , showing lassie ' s adoption by donald crisp ( as john " jock " gray ) . < br / > < br / > although it ' s based on an interesting , original story ( " greyfriars bobby " ) , " challenge to lassie " revisits several earlier lassie situations ; and , it does not improve upon them . comparatively speaking , this one is sloppy and unexciting ; and , it ' s a disappointing follow - up to " the sun comes up " ( 1949 ) * * * * * * * . geraldine brooks ( as susan brown ) and several of the other performers may be charming , but can ' t elevate this one . little jimmy hawkins ( from " it ' s a wonderful life " ) is among the notable children supporting lassie ; much later , he will grow up to marry " dark shadows " ' bewitching " angelique " ( lara parker ) . 
NEG this move is about as bad as they come . i was , however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery . there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley , one of the most breathtaking places in the us . it is also , starting with john ford , one of the most filmed . in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point . 
NEG this movie will promote the improvement of the mind . read a book ! it ' s incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make . i ' ve seen " b " movies before but the " c " movie has just been invented . i didn ' t think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into " knights . " high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume . embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind . my roommate , who loves these types of movies even turned it off . now that has to really tell you something . if you watch this movie , and like it , i will pray for you . 
NEG as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring . even liz taylor , james dean , chill wills , and dennis hopper can ' t float this overbloated boat . taylor actually looks bad - - wrong wardrobe , wrong hair , and wrong makeup - - a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career . hopper gives the only believable performance , and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don ' t remember him for - - a comic actor . rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a , say , redford could have done with the male lead . there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes , just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other . except for hopper , there is no character development , only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery . to its credit , the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects , and it does have size , making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests . those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk . you won ' t be missing anything of interest . 
NEG i saw this movie primarily to see brooke burke ( as jill ) , who i had meet briefly in la at a modeling trade show , in her first feature film . i was hoping to see more of her , but thought she did very well acting her role . since she is such a beautiful and poised tv host , and model , it was not surprising . i was left wondering why she was killed , and what happened as a result . maybe i just missed it . < br / > < br / > i wasn ' t really sure about the genre of this movie , and although i liked the actors i felt like it was for a college audience . i tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn ' t my favorite genre , but felt like i had outgrown the gags . it seemed to drag out in some places , leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had , and , like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending . < br / > < br / > having written a couple of scripts , i know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions , how many movies you have seen & studied , and those you relate with at a point in time . < br / > < br / > in a nutshell , i found it interesting , but not a satisfying plot and ending for me . if jill ( brooke burke ) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone ' s ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating . 
NEG when viewing a movie as silly as ' hot rod , ' one must sit back , relax , and alter one ' s intellectual capacity to a like state  which is , in this case , a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy . with a brief runtime of 88 minutes , this film was long past drawn - out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and weren ' t even funny in the first place . ' hot rod ' ' s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004 ' s cult hit ' napoleon dynamite , ' though it ' s much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter . in fact , the movie ' s blatant desperation to be compared to ' napoleon dynamite ' is scornful and offensive , and left me ticked off , instead of just being annoyed . < br / > < br / > the movie , if one were compelled enough to call it such , poses a paltry story that puts self - proclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us , with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses ( one more than his idol evel knievel jumped , so we ' re told by rod ) and raising $ 50 , 000 dollars for his stepfather ' s impending life - saving heart operation ; all so that he can fight his stepfather , once recovered , and gain his respect because in order to gain one ' s respect , one must first fight them . huh ? whatever . each character is no more interesting than rod ' s stick - on mustache , and from the film ' s opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion , each scene played like a nonsensical , and terribly unfunny , snl skit  which , with the addition of an extra 85 minutes , is , essentially , what ' hot rod ' strives to be . < br / > < br / > the film ' s star , andy samberg , contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip - drop of his comedic capabilities . unfortunately  rather , realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five - year - old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee - pee gags . and if that ' s disappointing , pull a chair , hide your face in your hands , and brace yourself for the real blow : he is the film ' s humor ! to rescue them of their mortification , i ' ll willingly omit the ghastliness of samberg ' s co - stars ' roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team , director akiva schaffer , to his non - existent talent as a director or a comedian . basically , every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash - course comedy is perfectly portrayed here ; and done so arrogantly , as though the film would be funnier that way . trick yourself into believing that there ' s even a single laugh in this heap , or treat yourself to another movie  any other movie . 
NEG if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have ! i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year , etc etc excuse me ? are you ppl snorting lsd or . . . . . . . . ? there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g ! i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap . < br / > < br / > i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes , i totally understand that , i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once ! < br / > < br / > do not watch this movie , do something else useful with your life do the dishes , walk the dog , hell . . . anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod . 
NEG pedantic , overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations . begins quite promisingly , with a still - relevant probe into an airplane explosion , however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way ( miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress , and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule ) . esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whitehead ' s book , but despite the talent involved , the picture fails to make much of an impression . best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart ' s partner , however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is . * 1 / 2 from * * * * 
NEG how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this ? it ' s amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - even the well - known gottfried john is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish . . . . . . . ! the screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie . be careful not to fall asleep while watching ! the set is obviously very often a blue screen , f . g . the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background . . . ! in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason : different languages of actors - but : other international productions do handle this much more professional . advice : do not watch - it ' s a diabolic waste of time ! 
NEG this picture reminds me of a keneth more picture from 1957 called the admirable crighton " whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant . madonna did ok in some movies however this one doesn ' t fire . if there is any picture that show madonna can ' t act it is this one . < br / > < br / > i am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of " the admirable crighton " but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad . to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail . < br / > < br / > the plot is loose and the acting is mediocre . the script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location . while many here have canned madoona for all her acting i think that in films like " a league of their own " was quite good and enjoyable and " who ' s that girl " showed a quirkiness of madonna ' s style not shown before or afterwards . other madonna films are not as enjoyable and i would have liked a to see a madonna animation series with the character from " who ' s that girl " i like the music from these two films however " swept away " remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so . < br / > < br / > everyone has a bomb right ? 
NEG this movie was extremely depressing . < br / > < br / > the characters were so cold . the mother , who is he main character , is everything but " motherly " . ok , she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first . her husband dies . she then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him . until this part , the movie is all right . not excellent , but it can be watched . the guy is charming and who can blame her ? ok it ' s not very motherly to sleep with your daughter ' s lover but let ' s blame that on the shock of losing her husband . < br / > < br / > she becomes totally obsessed with the guy . i think this is the part where i started to dislike the movie . she ' s always there wanting to please him in an " old fashioned way " with snacks while he is working on her son ' s house ( i guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do ) , as if it was the only way she could get his attention . the guy obviously is not very interested ( actually , it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity ) and instead of being insulted by that , she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive . " i want to please you " , she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly . < br / > < br / > what outraged me in this movie , is the utter lack of self - respect the mother has for herself . she tells craig something like " i am just a shapeless lump " the first time they sleep together . < br / > < br / > this movie is an insult to women kind . if it had been me , i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain . . . : ) 
NEG i didn ' t enjoy this movie at all . for one , i just found it crude and vulgar , for no reason . i also felt it ' s misogynistic ( against women . ) also , the movie really doesn ' t appear to be about anything , and i didn ' t find any of the characters likable . really , the there doesn ' t seem to be any point to it all . maybe i ' m missing something , but for me , this movie is pretty much a waste of time , when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable . like using my face as a pin cushion . james garner is in this thing , as are c . thomas howell and shirley jones , and james cromwell . all are wasted here , and i ' m sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers . jennilee harrison ( from the later years of three ' s company ) is also in the movie , and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role . but other than that , she can ' t rise above the mediocre script . for me , tank is a 3 / 10 
NEG i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i ' d seen , " burning moon " . but while that movie was rather grim and nasty , " premutos " seems to mostly play it for laughs . while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time ( and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this ) , i found myself constantly battling not to fast - forward to the next gore scene . sure , there ' s gore , and if that ' s all you want then go ahead and enjoy . but be warned : there ' s an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition . many are comparing this to peter jackson ' s movies , especially " braindead " . but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in " bad taste " , it ' s clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has - talent . 3 / 10 ( for pretty good and plentiful gore effects , and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money i paid for it ) 
NEG yeah , unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awful . < br / > < br / > first of all , the characters suck . i mean , come on , if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself ' orange sherbert ' is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character , then they should definitely not be in the film - making scene . poor " costumes " , bad " interviews " , and basically there is not one " wrestler " on this whole disc with any shred of charisma . < br / > < br / > the " wrestling " in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline . they make sure to giggle together all the while , too , making the experience seem more like a toddler ' s playtime than a " wrestling deathmatch " . < br / > < br / > basically , splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone . only , instead of blood , weapons , mayhem , and wrestling , we get a trampoline , giggling kids , terrible audio , and some guy called orange sherbert . < br / > < br / > wrestling fan or not , avoid this dvd . it ' s awful . 
NEG i ' d been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much . i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn ' t work for me . < br / > < br / > the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn ' t really seem to understand which genre it ' s falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama , horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it ' s a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none . < br / > < br / > the premise ( as with most revenge films ) is simple , couple meet and go out , something bad happens and they get their revenge it ' s a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years . unfotunately in this case it ' s as if dan reed thought , " it ' d be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail . . . . " wrong ! there are also a few key elements missing , in this type of movie there ' s generally some kind of warning . a don ' t do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there ' s nothing of the sort here . it just simply happens , then nothing happens for an hour , then something interesting happens and then it ends . < br / > < br / > there ' s a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying , i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing . . . i ' d say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he ' s making instead of trying to be too clever and he ' ll have a quality movie on his hands . 
NEG seriously , there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all . randolph scott , a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years , is at his most wooden and boring in the least role . at 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles , although it doesn ' t matter so much here because gail russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking . lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn ' t enough to save this garbage . thank god they don ' t make westerns any more , they ' re just dated , racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder . < br / > < br / > 0 / 10 . 
NEG i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting . i watched it despite the fact that i don ' t like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan hollinghurst writes ( sorry to his fans but i think we have a case of the emperor ' s new clothes with this author ' s work ) . i admit that the acting is excellent , it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it - however - i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production . the ' explicit ' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on tv - several times - so it was nothing very shocking i ' m afraid . full marks for production values but low ones for storyline / content i ' m afraid . 
NEG this film is just another distortion , among many distortions , on the so - called ' sins of consumerism ' . please note that ' reverend billy ' , an actor ( bill talen ) , is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the ' sins of consumerism ' . we might want to ask are questions , like : what does ' reverend billy ' do for a living ? how does he make his money ? does he make his living off his ' tax - deductible ' organization ? how does the internal revenue justify this as a ' tax - deductible ' church or organization ? < br / > < br / > everyone knows that christmas is commercialized , but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable , and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . everyone is not charitable . everyone does not spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . but , holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity . yes , america does have more than its share of problems - - but , with perseverance , americans have and always make it through great difficulties . and , even in times of strife , america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world . that happens when americans pull together and unite , rather than to separate and divide . yes , there are problems with corporations and monopolies , but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses , along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities . yes , globalization has brought us its share of problems , but it will take americans to bring production back to america . americans and the u . s . government need to learn how to stay on a budget , no matter how large or small it may be , and we must stop our dependence on credit . our over - reliance on credit will make , and keep us poor , from the cradle to the grave . it is important to buy - - but , if we buy less , we will rely less on credit . and , if we are able to save , even a small amount of money , we will have money for a rainy day . not to say that , as americans , we will gain an equal share of wealth . wealth is not guaranteed , and has never been guaranteed . but , stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america ' s wealth . there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper , middle class . and , who knows what can happen from there ? ! ? be positive , work hard - - and , at the very least , you and i will be able to reach at least some ( if not all ) of our dreams . in life , nothing is guaranteed , but we always have that something to reach for . and , if you or i don ' t have dreams , we might as well be dead . in america , there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams . as individuals , we are a part of the pack , but we always can become the leader of the pack . < br / > < br / > it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions , but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs , values , and perspectives . but , as far as the distortions expressed , within this film , i do not have any faith in such beliefs , values , and perspectives . i rank this film with a 1 out of 10 - - but , in all honesty and truth , this film deserves a zero . this film has no integrity , and i cannot recommend it . 
NEG about twenty minutes into this movie , i was already bored . quite simply , these characters were fairly dull . occasionally , something enjoyable would happen , but then things would slow down again . fortunately , my patience was eventually rewarded , and the ending to this movie wasn ' t bad at all . however , it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes . so , i would say that the movie was mediocre overall , and considering all of the talent in the cast , i ' d call this a disappointment . 
NEG i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series . it was so boring that i couldn ' t remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over , it even tires me to write a review on it . < br / > < br / > okay , # 4 was a joke and freddy was the joker . # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series . it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4 , which is a good thing , basically . they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy . unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares . because of that nightmare 5 : the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary . what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors ( maybe with the exception of lisa wilcox ) . < br / > < br / > the plot ( freddy killing lisa ' s friends by using the dreams of lisa ' s unborn child ) has a good base but it just isn ' t enough for 90 minutes of film . sometimes the story gets very confusing ( maybe because there isn ' t any ) and you can ' t stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at . the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself ( let me say that i don ' t like cheese though , even if i am from switzerland ) . not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4 . < br / > < br / > don ' t bother to rent / buy this film if not for completeness , it ' s quite a mess . < br / > < br / > my rating : 4 / 10 ( get used to it , # 6 is also a messy one . . . ) 
NEG " the dream child " of 1989 is the fifth film in the ( generally overrated ) " nightmare " series , and at the latest from this point on , the series became total garbage . the only good films in the series were wes craven ' s 1984 original , and the third part , " the dream warriors " of 1987 . the second part was disappointing and boring , and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes . this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for ( admittedly great ) visuals , and one creepy scene , a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence . the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor - clawed maniac - turned - jokester yelling stupid one - liners , and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses , who desperately try to avoid falling asleep , because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams . lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson , and a bunch of uninteresting crap , such as a super - dumb ' eerie ' children ' s rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel . . . in short : no originality , just a decline of the old formula , and an over - load of painfully annoying jokes . my ( generous ) rating of 3 / 10 is due to the great visuals , and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel , " freddy ' s dead " , which is awful beyond belief . in case you ' re not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast , " the dream child " should be avoided , and even if you are , this is more than likely to disappoint . 
NEG no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer . after all , very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take , and that was pretty much sinatra ' s modus operandi on set . < br / > < br / > i feel that as the 1960 ' s wore on , the quality of the man ' s films really started to tank . the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin ' s matt helm series which came out at the same time . perhaps even a james bond competition , but nothing really worked for frank during these years . his personal life in shambles , his music fading out . . . sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950 ' s . the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan ' s express in 1965 . 
NEG i ' ll keep this short , as i know i don ' t need to say much . < br / > < br / > " alive " is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some , but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning . the film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that i completely lost interest . as i said , i know others enjoyed it , but i found kitamura ' s " alive " to be anything but - a lame , extremely boring drama disguised as a thought - provoking action sci - fi flick . i felt like i was suckered into watching this film , based by its intriguing premise and uber - exciting cover art . < br / > < br / > my suggestion ? pass it up for kitamura ' s far more enjoyable freshman effort " versus " or his 2004 riot " godzilla : final wars " . < br / > < br / > . . . and don ' t get me wrong , i ' m always up for a good thinking man ' s film , but this certainly wasn ' t it . there was nary a moment that i actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly - preachy , dialogue - heavy movie . < br / > < br / > if you wanna talk about something . . . talk about boring . 
NEG basically this is an overlong , unfunny , action / comedy . first of all i ' d like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie ( 1 ) and the sequel had it ' s moments . unfortunately white chicks doesn ' t even deliver half the laughs . < br / > < br / > the humour in it is absolutely crude . if you like burping , farting , stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this . when it isn ' t crude it ' s idiotic . the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me , totally unfunny , simply idiotic . < br / > < br / > however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend ( otherwise i wouldn ' t have bothered ) . the story is undeniably thin , it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant . i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film , the laughs don ' t come quick enough . some jokes are dragged out too long when they ' re more disgusting than funny in the first place . if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this . if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie , airplane , hotshots 1 + 2 . < br / > < br / > 1 / 10 completely unfunny , thin storyline , a film that seems to be based on one idea ( i . e . what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film ? ) but simply didn ' t have enough material . 
NEG i suppose it ' s nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this . with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films , we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions , foul language , and corny one - liners . minimalism has its place , and can be very effective when employed properly . however , this film is not one of those cases . < br / > < br / > take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary , sparse scenery . i ' m sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight , because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement . the acting is poor . . . bland and pedestrian . . . and features one of the worst crying scenes in history ( at the end of the film , if you can sit through it to the end ) . the scenery is drab , and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled . i would call this anticlimatic , but as the film didn ' t build to any sort of climax whatsoever . . . not even in the " erotic " scenes . . . it would be untrue . i ' m sure that there was a script employed during the filming , but with the amount of dialogue , i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin . basically , this film offers nothing to interest or amaze . . . no great story , no stunning insights , no visual drama , no excitement . apart from two or three amusing moments , this film is a waste of two hours . a tragically boring and dreary film . 
NEG this movie was absolutely terrible . i can ' t believe i paid to see it in the theatre . i wouldn ' t watch it on free cable t . v . i ' m surprised that joe magtena even made it . do not waste your time with this movie . 
NEG you ' ll notice that the chemist , who appears in two scenes and gets to speak , is played by stephen king . " don ' t give up your day job " is the standard thing to say , but that ' s not fair . king acquits himself reasonably well : he ' s no worse than any other member of the cast , and better than most . the story , on the other hand , is pure rubbish . please , give up your day job . < br / > < br / > never have i seen so many dreadful performances - of which the lead actor ' s ( the lead actor ' s ! ) is probably the worst - gathered together in the one film . everyone acts hammily , but not in any entertaining way ; they all somehow manage to go over - the - top without expending , or manifesting , energy . i blame screenwriter / director tom holland . it can ' t be that all the actors are really this bad . what are the odds against that ? admittedly , i ' ve never heard of any of them before , but still , i don ' t think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried : one actor , despite my best efforts , would turn out to have talent . so what ' s more likely - that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake - eyes , or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly ? that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script . the more direction an actor got , the worse he performed . ( " you want me to bend over like a hunchback , talk from the back of my throat , show all my teeth , and look bored , all at the same time ? okay . . . " ) < br / > < br / > this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co - write a lousy script . several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character , but that ' s a misleading way of putting it . he ' s not a knowable character . all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he ' s fat , and that all he can think about is food . ( " all i can think about is food , " he tells us , helpfully . ) and in the end . . . < br / > < br / > ( sigh ) i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning here . . . < br / > < br / > in the end he becomes evil . why ? i can only shrug . perhaps he ' s under some kind of enchantment . yeah , that ' s probably it . by " evil " perhaps i mean " inexplicable " - it ' s not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means - end psychology . anyway , his actions at the end make no sense , nobody ' s actions make much sense , and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience . < br / > < br / > by the way , here ' s my nominee for hammiest line / delivery : " i don ' t think you ' d like it . in fact . . . " [ big dramatic pause ] " . . . i don ' t think you ' d like it at all . " 
NEG the only reason i remember this movie is because it was ( and still is ) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent . i was 17 and my friend was 18 . we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ( ok 2nd most ) . we walked out feeling so insulted , we wanted our money back , but the time could never be regained . < br / > < br / > the editing is what killed this movie . as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck . please , rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium ? what ' s worse is the these vw ' s manage to get 15 - 18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher . you would see on vw with 4 rockets fire 2 of them , cut around the truck with the last one attached , come back a second later with two rockets attached , fire another , then go in front of the truck and now it ' s back to a full set of 4 rockets . < br / > < br / > we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened . it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped . < br / > < br / > just ridiculous . 
NEG eric rohmer ' s ' the lady and the duke ' is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution . but it ' s a stilted affair , with its strange , painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone . most notably , this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action ; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie , and little of the chaos , poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted , but spoilt , aristocratic classes . the result is frequently dull , and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction ; it ' s a disappointing film from an acclaimed director . 
NEG although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl . film festival , there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this . one - - it ' s an ultra - low budget canadian film . two - - it ' s written , directed and starring the same person ( usually a bad sign , unless it ' s woody allen , george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers ) . but despite my watching it with lowered expectations , it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible . < br / > < br / > in a nutshell - - bad script , bad acting , terrible directing ! don ' t waste your time or money on this turkey . it claims to be a comedy , but i only laughed twice . plus , there is awful music blaring throughout . how this got any attention i ' ll never know . 
NEG this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd ! ! ! the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on . . . . but the story line is like a loose cannon . if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker - this one would have sprung from that . it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960 ' s , poor script writing and filming . < br / > < br / > the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver . the rest of the film , could have easily been made by middle school children . i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated . my advice - don ' t watch it ! ! ! 
NEG only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film . the rest of us should take a book , mp3 player , or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event . this can be best summed up as a " blown - up " tv movie being distributed into theaters . children will want to see this film , and they will like and be amused by the movie . 
NEG i have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that periodically appear on this film ' s imdb space . i saw this movie courtesy of subway cinema ' s new york asian film festival ( which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year , see vital , snake of june , cha no aji , survive style ) and have regretted every day that a scene from that movie disengorges itself from the back of my mind , and becomes a vivid memory . < br / > < br / > i ' m sure that you can read a laudatory summary of the film off of subway cinema , which is probably why i made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film . the description built up the kind of horror film that i had longed for for a while , one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares . p was in fact different . it relied on cheap laughs . < br / > < br / > the incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as " lesbians team up to fight monsters . " completely untrue . there is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and pookie is actually going somewhere . more lies . this film seems like a short made for " are you afraid of the dark ? " the story is ridiculous , and only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally rescinded their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the $ 9 that they wasted at the door . i almost wish paul spurrier was in the audience so that i could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad softcore horror - cum - porn that belongs on the spice channel , which only succeeded to get the actress excommunicated from her family , and caused a minor stir at the belgium film festival . the only stir that this caused was a gurgle in the lower intestine as it couldn ' t extract itself from the sh * te that it is . anyway , i hope i can dissaude anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film , it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences , knocking out soulplane for the number 2 . 
NEG this has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century . it is all the way low quality , but at the end it falls below . . . everything . all the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects . < br / > < br / > all the actors are below average , especially the main character anne fletcher ( simmone mackinnon ) . there is a scene , where anne is asked : " why you seem so careless ? " the correct answer is , because she can ' t act . no matter what happens ( the world is about to be destroyed , her friend is dying , she is fired ) , she has the same stupid grin in her face . < br / > < br / > it is not only the movie , which is b - quality . it is also the back cover description ( at least in finland ) . the text mentions things like lorica gray - vessel , capital - vessel and main character garrison harper and anna ( not anne ) fletcher . the description sounds like a different movie , both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters 
NEG it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie . that , to me and many others , is one of the greatest film noirs ever made . realizing this is simply a shortened made - for - tv film and that most people had trashed it , i didn ' t expect much , but you can ' t help but compare this with the ' 44 film . scene after scene , i found myself comparing what i was looking at it , and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray , barbara stanwyck , edward g . robinson and others . now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna , samantha eggar and lee j . cobb . < br / > < br / > when it was all over , i found it wasn ' t as bad as i had expected but it ' s no match for the 1944 original . the two main areas in which this made - for - tv film wasn ' t as good were ( 1 ) the electricity between the two leads was missing and ( 2 ) being only 90 minutes , they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot , characters and chemistry between those leads . crenna and eggar were flat , and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as " walter neff " and " phyllis dietrichson , " respectively . < br / > < br / > where this re - make held its own was in the other characters , such as " barton keyes " and " edward norton . " cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton , head of the insurance company . it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed , so the houses , cars , telephones , dictating machines , etc . , were all early ' 70s instead of mid ' 40s . otherwise , the storyline was very similar , just rushed . < br / > < br / > however , one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film . 
NEG i didnt think it was possible , but i have found film worse than ' body melt ' . this film is really really bad ! and what makes it worse is that its another australian film . . . < br / > < br / > shot on what looks like vhs , and with a terrible 80 ' s rock soundtrack , it just keep getting worse and worse , which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is ( skinned male hanging up - side - down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone ? ) . < br / > < br / > and why do their accents keep changing ? from bad new york drawl , to prissy english , then pure aussie ! and it happens to the whole cast ! < br / > < br / > this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover ( i believe it was the utah film festival ) . this has to be a lie because no - one in their right mind would nominate this for anything ( perhaps the golden rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell ) . < br / > < br / > come on guys ! this film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 ! ! ! it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there . < br / > < br / > well done to the " film " makers of this trash , for proving there is a reason not to see films . . . . . 0 / 10 
NEG gregory peck ' s acting was excellent , as one would expect , and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic " moment . " but , the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch , for me anyway . i tried to like it , but had to fast - forward through the last thirty minutes or so . i feel i wasted a couple of good hours . had it not been for gregory peck , i wouldn ' t have lasted fifteen minutes . 4 / 10 . 
NEG robert forster , normally a very strong character actor , is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion . scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the " death wish " vein . it isn ' t difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings : the dialogue is full of howlers , the crime statistics are irrevocably dated , and the supporting characters are ridiculously over - written ( particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom ) . low - rent production is contemptible in its self - righteousness , especially as the violence in our cities has only increased . * from * * * * 
NEG the hysterical thing about this movie is that , according to the director , it has difficulty finding a distributor in the u . s . because most of them that viewed it couldn ' t reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of christianity and american angst . the thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable . < br / > < br / > because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone " godspeed " this makes it a " christian " movie ? one could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the " land of plenty " with all of its material excess , the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse . plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe ? plenty of useless homeless missions ? how about plenty of psycho vietnam vets ? as a pill - popping delusional survivor of agent " pink " are we to think america is a " land of plenty " of paranoid patriots ? maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients ? certainly we don ' t have plenty of people concerned about palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film . of course if you worked in a german homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how europe is the " continent of plenty " when it comes to sophistication . < br / > < br / > indeed i agreed with the title in the end as the united states is the " land of plenty " and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts , amateur acting and dispassionately directed films . life is too short and one , even an american , doesn ' t have " plenty " of time to waste watching this piece . 
NEG wenders was great with million $ hotel . i don ' t know how he came up with this film ! the idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of american society is hopeful , that makes it 2 out of ten . but this is not a movie . is that the best someone can do with a great idea ( the west - east clash ) . there are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a mac * with the fingers of an amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity ( because she is just ignorant about the facts ) . the characters are not well shaped . and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . at the ending scene lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen . and the background music says " . . . i will pray " . the thing is not about religion actually . but it ends up with this . how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . the lights are already shining on the truth . its just that nobody wants to see it . ps : " my home is not a place . it is people " the only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence . but it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; as " someone " mentioned below , americas finest young man are not finest , they are just the " poor " and the " hopeless " ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! ) 
NEG i sat glued to the screen , riveted , yawning , yet keeping an attentive eye . i waited for the next awful special effect , or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force , so i could learn how not to make a movie . < br / > < br / > it seems when they set out to make this movie , the crew watched every single other action / science - fiction / shoot - em - up / good vs . evil movie ever made , and saw cool things and said : " hey , we can do that . " for example , the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking , is the one car the protagonist , an attractive brunette born of bile , is thrown on to . the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it . the special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie . but what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility , and lack of reason for so many elements ! for example , the antagonist , a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways , happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important vip . nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck , you know they are already dead . then the guy protecting the vip says " under no circumstances do you leave this truck , do you understand me ? " he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies , he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion . then for no apparent reason , defying logic , convention , and common sense , the dumb ass vip gets out of the truck ! ! ! a lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn ' t make sense . transparent acting distanced me from the movie , as well as bad camera - work , and things that just make you go : " wow , that ' s incredibly cheesy . " shiri appleby saved the movie from a 1 , because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience , sex appeal . 
NEG an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many . well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced , yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion . the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed . the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate , but i cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie . 
NEG this is a very odd film . . . i wasn ' t really sure what is was about , some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all , in their own way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster . the film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied , almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all . i didn ' t care about any of the characters - none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer . < br / > < br / > what was the message ? am i being dim ? it was just too odd . what happens to runner ? why does emilio shoot the kid ? . . . that made absolutely no sense , pointless . can someone help me understand this mess of a film ? 
NEG i had watched " the eye " before i watched this one . i really liked " the eye " , it was one of the best movies of the recent asian horror - cinema . so , i picked this " bangkok haunted " because it was the same director , and it was kind of popular round here . but man , what a disappointment . . . " bangkok haunted " are three stories about love , revenge , ghosts , etc . that are no scary at all , not even disturbing ( as " the eye " was ) . . . no nothing . i can ' t even fill the 10 lines required for the comment . . . < br / > < br / > 100 % boring . < br / > < br / > * my rate : 2 / 10 
NEG this movie is really wack . there is really nothing nice i can say about it , besides the moral truth expressed in the film ' s climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime . besides all that , the film had nothing : no good shots , no good acting , and no good script . i give this film a f and a 2 out 10 . 
NEG you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema ? you ' re stuck there in the best seat in the house , centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there , uncomfortable and itchy , thinking " when the f * * * is this film ever going to end ? ? ? " ( you know the feeling - think of a . i . and the village ) . < br / > < br / > well , visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling . i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f * * * ing start ! it is interminable ! so " arty " it hurts . this is the first miike takashi film i have watched . apparently he makes films by the dozen and , if they are all pretentious w @ nk like this , i suspect it will be the last . < br / > < br / > i ' m not against pretentious w @ nk . david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cut - rate , cheap , and nasty pretentious w @ nk . < br / > < br / > as you may have worked out by now - i hated it . 
NEG there is nothing cool , hip , or clever about this film - - liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema . how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . serial killers ! if they have to dismember total strangers in order to " be a family again , " then we don ' t want them to " be a family . " what part of that did you have trouble grasping ? why applaud this filth ? < br / > < br / > this silly filth is what you do if you can ' t do art ! one ' s head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as " interesting . " this is a camera without a brain . what really makes an artwork cool is profundity , questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history ( or , in this case , a knowledge of anything would be preferable ! ) . instead , this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown , thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as " cool cause it ' s so far out , man ! " ) . these same violent events actually happen , every day . they are not " just in the film . " they refer to actual soul - less people who would do those same things to you . do you want those things done to you ? a child could have thought this up , it required zero imagination , it is not surrealism . this lazy crap has no content , is saying nothing - - it ' s just the worst of the evening news , & it is saying nothing new , nothing we don ' t already know . it ' s " the emperor ' s new clothes , " the director hoping there are enough uneducated children , proud of their streak of inhumanity , for this sloppy filth to fly . i can see director miike ' s demented fans now : chain - smoking teens - and - twenties drunks covered in tattoos , with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces , their knowledge - base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves . < br / > < br / > there is no plot to this - - it is just sheer exploitation of shock - value violence . there is no " hidden meaning " anywhere in this poorly made film . it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic , but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there ! to do that you need to view & review a real piece of cinema . there are plenty out there , directed by fellini , bergman , fassbinder , herzog , altman , bunuel , kurosawa , lynch , tarkovsky , peter greenaway , tarantino , guillermo del toro , richard linklater , eisenstein , aronofsky , gus van sant , soderbergh , shyamalan , ordet . why don ' t you view a real art film by the likes of these giants ? this wannabe director , miike , will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn ' t have the talent ! anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like " visitor q . " teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon ! there ' s no message , no meaning , no plot , nothing to it at all . there are long lists of art films to learn from - - but this " visitor q " is not an art film in any respect . it has no content to it . it ' s just one banal horror piled onto another , and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen , every single day , somewhere in the world . they are not okay because they are " just in the film . " they refer to actual soul - less people who would do those same things to you . do you want those things done to you ? to others ? why ? because this world is already ugly enough , thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this . < br / > < br / > there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct , but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap . there is no deeper meaning . there is nothing to analyze ; why keep trying ? i ' ve spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made , and keeping up with all the new ones , but i ' ve never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this . it ' s not imaginative or even shocking , because these types of events happen daily all over the world . to make this film , or even to favorably review it , has caused over 50 young airheads who don ' t know any better to think it ' s " cool . " they may grow up thinking that , convincing others , some of whom may end up doing these things - - convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way , by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity . trust me on this , - - i know cool , and cool this piece of crap ain ' t . visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film , and i ' m still not sure it isn ' t , actually . < br / > < br / > your actions have consequences , son . the world is awful enough already . some violence like this could happen to you , or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film . believe me , you won ' t be thinking it ' s " cool " when someone is sawing your skull in half ! 
NEG the first ten minutes of " just looking " really dictates the direction most of this movie takes . lenny ( ryan merriman ) is a 14 year old boy living in new york in the ' 50s . he has a burning desire to see two people have sex . who are the best people he has in mind ? well , his own mom and stepfather of course ! how pleasant . unfortunately for lenny , he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle ' s wife . < br / > < br / > lenny ' s next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex . however , the wife is quite pregnant and they aren ' t currently sleeping together . then lenny makes a new friend . him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls . they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex . the problem is . . . it ' s not done in an innocent , charming 1950 ' s sort of way . i am no prude by any means , but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation , blowjobs and anal sex . that kind of rawness may work in a movie like " kids " ( 1995 ) but in this film it just seems perverted . < br / > < br / > gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy , a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny ' s carnal desires . jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director ' s chair as possible . " for better or worse " ( 1996 ) was awful and now this . what a waste . 1 / 10 
NEG here are the matches . . . ( adv . = advantage ) < br / > < br / > the warriors ( ultimate warrior , texas tornado and legion of doom ) v the perfect team ( mr perfect , ax , smash and crush of demolition ) : ax is the first to go in seconds when warrior splashes him for the pin ( 4 - 3 adv . warriors ) . i knew ax wasn ' t a healthy man but if he was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card ? this would be his last ppv . eventually , both legion of doom and demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification ( 2 - 1 adv . warriors ) . perfect applies the perfect plex on texas tornado for the pin . he then attempts the same on warrior but warrior no - sells it and kicks out . warrior comes back with a splash to pin perfect and become the sole survivor . 5 / 10 < br / > < br / > the dream team ( dusty rhodes , koko b ware and the hart foundation v million dollar team ( ted dibiase , mystery partner and rhythm and blues ) : the mystery partner is the undertaker and , on his debut , makes an impact disposing of koko straight away with the tombstone ( monsoon still manages to say his correct height , weight and finishing move while pretending not to know who he is ) making it 4 - 3 to dibiase ' s team . niedhart power - slams honky for the pin ( 3 - 3 ) and his career with the wwf is over . shortly afterwards , it is niedhart who falls victim to dibiase with help from virgil ( 3 - 2 adv . dibiase ' s team ) . rhodes next after an undertaker double axe - handle off the top rope but doesn ' t leave quietly attacking brother love . undertaker goes after dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man ( 2 - 1 adv . dibiase ' s team ) . almost straight after , greg gets caught in a cradle by hart trying to put the figure four leg - lock on him and gets pinned . it comes down to hart v dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling , bret gets his body - cross reversed by dibiase for the pin . dibiase is the sole survivor . at least hart is put to good use . 6 / 10 < br / > < br / > the vipers ( jake ' the snake ' roberts , ' superfly ' jimmy snuka and the rockers ) v visionaries ( rick ' model ' martel , warlord and power and glory ) : after spending some time in the ring , marty jannetty gets power slammed by warlord as he comes off the top rope for the pin ( 4 - 3 adv . visionaries ) . snuka gets pinned in seconds by martel who reverses his body cross ( 4 - 2 adv . visionaries ) . michaels gets caught in the power plex and pinned by roma ( 4 - 1 adv . visionaries ) . it is now roberts against four men resembling his survivor series effort two years before . despite hitting warlord with the ddt , roberts gets counted out chasing after martel . the visionaries are the first team in survivor series history to completely survive as one . not much here worth watching to be honest as the psychology is rushed . 3 / 10 < br / > < br / > hulkamaniacs ( hulk hogan , ' hacksaw ' jim duggan , bigbossman and tugboat ) v natural disasters ( earthquake , dino bravo , barbarian and haku ) : one bossman slam eliminates haku early in the bout ( 4 - 3 adv . hulkamaniacs ) . duggan gets his 2 by 4 out after whacking earthquake with it to get disqualified ( 3 - 3 ) . bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing hogan to cradle him for the pin ( 3 - 2 adv . hulkamaniacs ) . earthquake manages to overcome bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards ( 2 - 2 ) . hogan gets beat down and finally tugboat gets a tag ( who knew he was there at this point ? ) , he wrestles for about 30 seconds before getting counted out with earthquake . only hogan and barbarian left . barbarian puts in some nice offence but inevitably gets caught in the big boot and leg drop for the pin . hogan is the sole survivor . 4 / 10 < br / > < br / > the alliance ( nikolai volkoff , tito santana and bushwhackers ) v mercenaries ( sgt slaughter , boris zhukov and orient express ) : all of the mercanaries wore camouflage face paint . lightning quick pins here with santana pinning zhukov in his last ppv in seconds ( 4 - 3 adv . alliance ) . there wasn ' t even a bolshevik showdown . bushwhackers hit sato with the battering ram even though tanaka was the legal man ( 4 - 2 adv . alliance ) and would be his last appearance on wwf ppv as the orient express get repackaged . tanaka follows sato when santana stuns him with the flying forearm ( 4 - 1 adv . alliance ) . despite slaughter getting in the ring against four men , he eliminates volkoff ( who ' s career is over after this ) , butch and luke in that order with relative ease . finally , santana beats slaughter by disqualification when general adnan hits him with iraqi flag . at last some interesting booking even though the match was awful . santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes his last finest hour . 3 / 10 < br / > < br / > the egg hatches and it ' s hector guerrerro in a silly outfit . he dances with gene okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while piper and monsoon pretend they are enjoying it . < br / > < br / > match of survival : ultimate warrior , hulk hogan and tito santana v warlord , power and glory , rick ' model ' martel and ' million dollar man ted dibiase : just merely another catalogue of eliminations as santana pins warlord in seconds with flying forearm at least avenging his previous summerslam defeat ( 4 - 3 adv . dibiase ' s team ) . dibiase stun guns santana afterwards for the pin ( 4 - 2 adv . dibiase ' s team ) . hogan kicks out of the power plex and proceeds to pin roma after a clothesline , effectively killing off power and glory ' s push ( 3 - 2 adv . dibiase ' s team ) . hogan eliminates martel by count - out and dibiase with the leg drop for the pin ( 2 - 1 adv . hogan ' s team ) . hogan finally allows warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis hercules after a splash . a very predictable ending to the point of nauseous . 2 / 10 < br / > < br / > overall , too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned . most of the heels were decimated by warrior and hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers . 
NEG it ' s amazing to see how nikhil advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release . i mean . . . . . look at the cast here , the promotion is superb , good enough songs and the trailers are fine . this makes it a house full on the first day , but it ' s only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable . house full the first day , the movie is out the next week . < br / > < br / > this film , inspired by ' love actually ' is what they say , didn ' t manage to handle the whole cast well . they tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one . the stories are hollow and cheesy , so the audience can ' t connect with any single one of them . it ' s a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter nikhil advani after his big success of ' kal ho na ho ' . 
NEG a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers . the mystery is whether or not jane graystone ( nancy coleman ) has amnesia . the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr . ingersoll , a good doctor turned evil . he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac jane , coded information related to allied activities . will she tell ? can she remember ? moroni olson ( as mr . goodwin ) is convincing as an accomplice to massey . the role played by john garfield ( as dr . lewis ) is nothing short of disastrous . he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history . it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents . the movie is worth one look , despite being a half spy and half gangster film , and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters . it ' s easy to forget this one , amnesia is not necessary . 
NEG generally , i ' ve found that if you don ' t hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd , there ' s probably a good reason for it . i hadn ' t heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf . since all the good movies had already been rented out ( the ones i wanted to see , anyway ) , i figured i ' d give this one a shot . < br / > < br / > it ' s really not much different than other movies in the genre , such as the singles ward or the r . m . if you ' re into those type movies , you ' ll probably enjoy this . < br / > < br / > however , if you ' re not a mormon , this movie probably won ' t appeal to you . there ' s no way to avoid the overtly religious ( mormon ) message contained within , and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy . ultimately , if you don ' t fall within the mormon demographic , you ' re probably better off watching something else . < br / > < br / > admittedly , there were some very funny moments in the film , but i didn ' t think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall . 
NEG ' baptists at our barbecue ' is the best film ever made . now , that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken , let me begin my short overview of this tacky , offensive , pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie . first of all , the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa , and the tacky , overly preachy , whiny and stilted screenplay by f . mathew smith . i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro - mormon , and sort of anti - every other religion message . yes , the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists . it shows all the main and role - model characters being mormon , and being so nice and perfect , yet they are being picked on by the evil , conniving and very judgmental baptists . it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold - hearted and ignorant baptists are , instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic . i ' m a part of neither religion ( i ' m actually an atheist ) , but this offended me , along with another countless amount of baptists most likely . it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons , and the mormons being very accepting , when again , in reality there is a mutual like / dislike between them . sorry , i didn ' t mean to go off on a rant . < br / > < br / > another aspect of ' baptists at our barbecue ' i didn ' t much care for , was the acting . the performances are very amateurish and unnatural , especially from the female lead heather beers . miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role , and i wasn ' t too much impressed with dan merkley , who ' s the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture , but i have to say he ' s way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers . whoever played the town sheriff was awful also . although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film , it is full of clichés . for example , the main character , tartan ( merkley ) , finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life - how cliché is that ? to make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché , tartan buys the poor , lonely heathen a puppy dog . ugghhh ! < br / > < br / > if you want my advice , stay as far away from ' baptists at our barbecue ' as you can . i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion . all i got was a , well , piece of crap . grade : d - < br / > < br / > my ratings guide - a + ( absolutley flawless ) ; a ( a masterpiece , near - perfect ) ; a - ( excellent ) ; b + ( great ) ; b ( very good ) ; b - ( good ) ; c + ( a mixed bag ) ; c ( average ) ; c - ( disappointing ) ; d + ( bad ) ; d ( very bad ) ; d - ( absolutley horrendous ) ; f ( not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces ) . 
NEG i wasn ' t sure whether to laugh or cry . porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw . costumes ? what costumes ? a t - shirt with strips of black leather on it . it was marion ' s clothes - - or lack of them - - that really got me . do the ' fans ' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england . the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid , but the episode with an alien was worst of all . especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face - - an old trick . the hedgehog monster was pretty funny , as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows - - as if . the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over ' raw - bin hood and liddle john ' . the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan . . . 
NEG i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago , and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day . it ' s not that bad for a made - for - tv horror movie , but it is derivative ( mostly of the exorcist ) and businesslike , for lack of a better word . it won ' t blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting , but it ' s not a waste of time , either . it ' s the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren ' t in the mood to think too hard . < br / > < br / > however , if you go into the movie looking for some laughs , you won ' t be disappointed . the early scenes , with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non - threatening , and the climactic blue - screen effects of a giant black dog ( with horns ! ) are pretty side - splitting . and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning . < br / > < br / > not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination , but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv . 
NEG note to george litman , and others : the mystery science theater 3000 riff is " i don ' t think so , * breeder * " . < br / > < br / > my favorite riff is " why were you looking at his ' like ' ? " , simply for the complete absurdity . that , and " right well did not ! " over all , i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie . you really can ' t make much fun of the dialog ; bill s was a good playwright . on the other hand , this production is so bad that even he would disown it . a junior high school drama club could do better . < br / > < br / > i would recommend that you buy a book and read ' hamlet ' . 
NEG there ' s really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis . i mean it ' s shakespeare ' s hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written . i ' m not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have  through mystery science theater 3000 . while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie , in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips . in a word , this german , made - for - tv version of hamlet is dreary . 152 minutes ? no way ! it ' s too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on . i ' ve said it any number of times , but entertainment is the thing for me . and this wrist - slitter is far from entertaining . i will , however , give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting . a 3 / 10 sounds about right to me . < br / > < br / > as much as i enjoy mst3k , their comments don ' t help to make hamlet any more palatable . there are a few good riffs here and there , but overall , hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst3k . shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow . as much as it pains me , i ' ve got to give hamlet a 1 / 5 on my mst3k rating scale . 
NEG i ' ve been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting . of course , i am catholic , come from a well - educated family and go to church of my own volition , which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bill ' s opinions . < br / > < br / > bill ' s problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative . he ' s correct to document the sociological aspects of it i . e . one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion ( or , more accurately , by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god ) , but that said he never looks at its positive side . quite frankly , i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor . she ' s dead now of course , but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries , which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills , get their tattoos removed , and to become responsible members of society , or he could visit usc ' s institute for advanced catholic studies , which has brought together some of the world ' s finest theologians , diplomats , and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world ' s poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world ' s people who live on less than $ 1 a day . of course he won ' t do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion , and it ' s so much easier to continue to make snide , superficial jokes . < br / > < br / > that fits into the other large problem with bill ' s movie , which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is . in this movie , you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service , in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time , with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ , and with an actor playing jesus at a " holy land " theme park . < br / > < br / > what you won ' t see in bill ' s film , beyond some superficial speculation alongside a ph . d in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses , is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame , byu , or wheaton college , who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter . you won ' t see any serious discussion of any of the writings of c . s . lewis , g . k . chesterton , or any papal encyclicals , and of course you also won ' t find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non - abrahamic ( judaism , christianity , and islam ) faiths whatsoever . all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending , snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut - level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w . bush ( twice ) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it . < br / > < br / > i get a lot of what bill ' s saying , but for someone possessing his intellect and influence , this film was nothing less than pathetic . anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies . 
NEG i ' ve been working my way through a collection of lugosi films recently , and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of lugosi and boris karloff in " the black cat " i was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in " the raven . " alas , it just didn ' t work for me , and by the end of the film i was quite disappointed . < br / > < br / > for the first three quarters of this movie or so i thought the story lacked any real suspense . lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad dr . vollins , some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman ( irene ware ) he treats after a car accident but who can ' t have her - partly because she ' s already engaged , and partly because her father ( samuel s . hinds ) disapproves . to deal with that situation , he enlists the aid of edmond bateman ( boris karloff ) - a horribly ugly man who wants vollins to make him look more acceptable . aside from lugosi ' s performance , though , i found little to hold my interest . then , suddenly , in the last fifteen or twenty minutes , the movie shifts around completely . suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful , but i thought lugosi ' s performance fell apart , largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane - and there ' s a difference . he plays the " mad " role very well - controlled and in control but evil . " insane " is a more out of control evil , and i didn ' t think lugosi pulled that off well . at one point , he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake . in the meantime , karloff was a huge disappointment . he never grabbed me at all . as an aside , it must have grated on lugosi that - in movies in which they co - star - karloff gets the top billing , even though in " the raven " it ' s clearly lugosi who is the lead actor . this surely gives a hint as to how universal ranked their two great horror stars - inexplicably , i would add , because i ' ve always thought of lugosi as the better actor of the two . < br / > < br / > in any event , there ' s no real connection here to edgar allen poe ' s story " the raven " - except that vollins is a poe fanatic , who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from poe ' s stories . overall , a disappointment . 4 / 10 . 
NEG overall this movie is dreadful , and should have never been made . one of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters , for example , if she is about to be attacked , you want to feel , " oh my god , no ! " , but you don ' t in this case , you don ' t care because there is no link that has been made to know the character . in the trailer , it seemed as though the movie would be great , yet there is no suspense what so ever really . there could have been maybe some mystery but there is not . " all she has is a toolbox . " was said on the dvd ' s back , you would think that it was carefully planned this movie , and cleverly made , but it is not , the ending , was just awful , very straight forward , and pointless too . the acting is either average or below average , maybe even lower . in my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life . the " special effects " and sets were average too , nothing special what so ever . there is not much gore , or bloody violence , not much blood is shown . this movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing , yet really , its not even worth looking for , i do not recommend this to anyone , unless they are easily satisfied , by a few fights and a boring story . 
NEG kevin spacey is very talented , but unfortunately directing is not his forte . i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much . i admire spacey ' s attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting , but it ' s not the attempt that counts . i found the film dull , boring , and stretched out . the acting was nothing spectacular . gary sinise has done much better , especially since he is conscious in most of his other films . skeet ulrich was disappointing , but this was one of his first films ( i did get a kick out of how young and chubby this scream star looked ) . the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above . the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck . however , that shot was very " usual suspects " ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his ( which is very good mind you ) . if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting , watch hitchcock ' s lifeboat . maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this . 
NEG serious home alone / karate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot . you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene . oh , and the acting sucks too . although i must say that the line : " sorry , dude , i have to take a major dump big time " made me laugh my ass off . 
NEG i don ' t often give one star reviews , but the computer won ' t let me do negative numbers . < br / > < br / > the opening titles tell us we ' re in deep water already . although this is a low budget exploitation film , there are 17 producers credited . no . no . < br / > < br / > at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community . the house is a pigsty . his wife , della ( kim basinger ) has let the children run amok all day . < br / > < br / > ok . we ' re already in deep water . ms . basinger was 55 years old when the film came out . uh , are these her children or grandchildren ? it ' s christmas eve . della drives to the mall , a lengthy scene that could have been cut . to bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on christmas eve . sure . for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it . < br / > < br / > we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes , though . it ' s raining and traffic is bad . first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time . then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time , at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone . < br / > < br / > she wanders the mall , sees an old friend from college , tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined - gosh , maybe her husband is grumpy because he ' s going broke , but that ' s too complicated for the script to follow . < br / > < br / > in the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films . one white boy ( lukas hass watching his career go down the toilet ) , one black , one asian , and one hispanic . imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and you ' ll have the idea . < br / > < br / > although they have a gun she gives them attitude . a mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head , firing more than once . the parking lot is crowded as can be , people everywhere , and nobody notices . < br / > < br / > della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area , she drives to a construction site , where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools ( literally ) at hand . < br / > < br / > major spoiler ahead . < br / > < br / > she drives back home . the car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain . checks on the children , goes downstairs , and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range . < br / > < br / > the experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for della . instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home , because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges . the four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense . the husband , different story . < br / > < br / > i ' m so glad i saw this on cable . if i ' d seen it in a theater ( did it get any release ? ) i ' d have been furious . as is , i ' m just sad seeing talents like ms . basinger and mr . haas waste themselves on garbage like this . < br / > < br / > one very good thing , though . this was written and directed by susan montford . ms . montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd . there is justice in the world . 
NEG this is not horror , as the first part was : this is ( " campy " ) light and humorous entertainment . like in so many sequels , the action starts right away with no explanations . but there ' s boobs , so i don ' t complain . and real boobs that is . if i understand correctly , those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u . s . of a . which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela " bruce ' s sister " springsteen . < br / > < br / > this cannot be thought without the first movie , so i compare this to it . again there is too small clothing ( mainly pants ) and funny hair , it ' s not hard to tell what decade this film is made in . again there is really strange characters , this time even more visibly " pathological " ones . especially the personnel of the camp . it ' s like some mental rehabilitation summer camp . people are older : most of the actors must be at least 25 , but i think they ' re supposed to be 16 or something . some " methods " used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant . actually this movie don ' t have much in common with the first part , and this is worse than it in every way . 
NEG this movie is not good . the first one almost sucked , but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching . this one has nothing . there ' s zero scare , zero tension or suspense . this isn ' t really a horror movie . most of the kills don ' t show anything . there ' s no gore to speak of . this could almost be a tv , except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence . the acting is not very good , either . and don ' t get me started on the dialogue . as for the surprise ending , surprise , there isn ' t one . i suppose it could have been worse , although i don ' t see how . but then again , it is less than 80 minutes long , so i guess that ' s a good thing . although it felt a lot longer . apparently this is the cut version of the film . i found it for a very cheap price , but it still not worth it . if you want the uncut more graphic version , check out the anchor bay edition . anyway , this version of sleepaway camp ii : unhappy campers gets a big fat 1 / 10 from me . p . s . if you watch this movie , you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper . if you are a real fan , you might want to pick up anchor bay ' s sleepaway camp ( with survival kit ) three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features 
NEG being a slasher film aficionado , i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas , which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain , i will say . while channel surfing the other night , sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me . of course , i wanted to check it out , as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise , but have never actually seen any of them ( for shame , i know ) . i will note that since i have not seen the original , my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously , because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise ' s own design . < br / > < br / > now i ' m assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is , in itself , a joke on itself . hell , even the name comes off as an intentional joke . sleep away camp ? it ' s good fun . i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value , but that ' s about as far as i can go . the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth . campy requires bad acting , but come on . pamela springsteen as the evil out - of - touch - with - reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast . as far as comedy goes , there were a few times where i chuckled , but it was few and far between . < br / > < br / > ultimately , sac ii is pretty boring , and i really did want to sleep away the camp . the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them . if you ' re looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp , i recommend club dread . if your channel surfing takes you across this one , check and see what else is on . 
NEG well what i can say about this movie is that it ' s great to see so many asian faces . what i didn ' t like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role . the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead , the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the " keeping it real " black cab driver . plus all the coke , shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious . the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel . then again when watching romantic comedies you can ' t expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once . the parents are the best part of the flick . 
NEG don ' t get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot . i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re : death on the nile . everyone has done this one ! we know who dies . we know why they die . we know who the killer is . we know how it was done . so i say enough already ! mr . suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie ' s novels . i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . the sets were terrific and very realistic . i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how ' awful ' he looked . i hope he doesn ' t look that way in ' real ' life ! i honestly can ' t remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . somehow i don ' t think so . i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms . christie wrote it that way . i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison ! 
NEG terrible story , poor acting and no humour at all ( apart from the final joke at the end ) < br / > < br / > some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home . supposed to be a kiddies movie , but even they will not be amused by this terrible film 
NEG ever since i was eight years old i have been a big wrestling fan . it didn ' t matter what federation i watched . wwe , wcw , uswa . to me the action is all i watched it for . < br / > < br / > may 23rd 1999 . that was my 19 birthday . i ordered over the edge and i was just expecting another pay per view . but this time . i was wrong . instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong . not much you can do to change the situation . but what happened affter owens death made me very mad . < br / > < br / > rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the wwe decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if owens death never happened . < br / > < br / > i gotta tell you . vince mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made . < br / > < br / > and this crap with saying owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going . give me a break . when someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it . thats like a police officer shooting a robber or a mugger with a run and then just leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the mans life never mattered . < br / > < br / > but no matter what happens . owen will be missed and thanks for the memories for all the times you gave us . 
NEG you get 5 writers together , have each write a different story with a different genre , and then you try to make one movie out of it . it ' s action , it ' s adventure , it ' s sci - fi , it ' s western , it ' s a mess . sorry , but this movie absolutely stinks . 4 . 5 is giving it an awefully high rating . that said , it ' s movies like this that make me think i could write movies , and i can barely write . 
NEG the special effects of this movie are , especially for its time , laughable and used in such an over - emphasized way that you can ' t deny their terrible existance . < br / > < br / > the acting redefines the term " terrible overacting " at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul , where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine " bad " . < br / > < br / > * * * spoilers * * * < br / > < br / > the charm in this movie can be found in two things : first is the excellent casting of carel " lurch " struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt , who can sense where and when people will die and is always there . < br / > < br / > the second are original finds , the combination sf - western is obviously original , if terrible , but other finds are more original , like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots ( though his acting falls short here ) . < br / > < br / > overal . . . don ' t see this movie , except if you love that ol ' hunk - o - brutal carel struycken , as any self - respecting dutchman should . 
NEG wow . rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately , but this one especially is begging for a beatdown . let ' s start at the beginning . first , writer - director susan montford puts kim basinger in the tired old victim role , complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence . let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite . montford ' s pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the christmas tree with no star is laughable . < br / > < br / > when she goes out for some christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night , della is furious that somebody double - parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year . she decides to do something about it , so she leaves a nasty note on the car ' s windshield . the next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall . when she finally gets to her car , the thugs confront her about the note , a cop is killed , and she runs , and they catch up to her , and she gets away , and they chase her some more , and on and on . everything is completely predictable and uninvolving . the thugs are not scary or menacing at all , and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways . < br / > < br / > this is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine . why the bad guys don ' t just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me . and once , just once , in a film like this , does the leader of the pack have to die last ? what does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept ? much of the movie simply consists of lukas haas running around in the woods screaming " della ! ! ! " and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting . < br / > < br / > the part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when della , exhausted and hurt , cries out to the heavens , " where are you , god ? " where , indeed , was god when this movie was being made ? i give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting , and it ' s not as bad as ' btk killer , ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film . cheers ! 
NEG humm , an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair , i wasn ´ t expecting very much , to be honest and in fact , i took even less than i was expecting . it doesn ´ t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this . apart from that you are going to love some special effects , they are really cheesy and bad . now i only want to watch " troll 3 " by this same director , sure it is not going to be worse than that . 
NEG for 50 years after world war 2 the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests . at the same time , because of the draft and wars , everyone in society had served , or was connected to someone who had . < br / > < br / > this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine . sometimes that machine was non - us military , for example in prisoner of war situations . once removed are stories in other machines : science fiction and corporate , but they always reference this military genre , and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling . < br / > < br / > you can trace it , i think , perhaps starting in the comic , meaning amrican , sections of " the great escape , " which immediately spawned teevee offspring in " gomer pyle " and " hogan ' s heros . " then a second wave triggered by " catch 22 " and " mash , " both of which had been real life , then books , then movies , and in the mash case , then teevee . < br / > < br / > but before all that , there was the " phil silvers show , " about a sergeant bilko and this followed from " mister roberts . " a happy con man , who only committed harmless crimes , and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life . this was in the day when teevee shows mattered . you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about . it wasn ' t particularly clever in any way , except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom . < br / > < br / > its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable , even endearing lies in a military context , a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here . < br / > < br / > because its big , it sometimes pays off in laughs . " stripes " was pretty darn funny i thought . it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes , sort of folding in some " dirty dozen . " and sexual adventure . < br / > < br / > now this , well before the cultural wars escalated . it tries to touch that sweet spot , like other remakes that manhandled steve martin . it is so unfunny , you actually root for the army to be the stronger player . yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power . < br / > < br / > ted ' s evaluation - - 1 of 3 : you can find something better to do with this part of your life . 
NEG maybe i ' m really getting old , but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely . surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman ( that ' s me , schultz ! ) . lordy , lordy what i would give to see the light ! firstly , that phil silvers manic energy , wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life , if you will . although it is possible that the series , first titled : " you ' ll never get rich " ( 1955 - 59 * ) could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt . bilko , it is very hard to picture any other actor / comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant ' s stripes . < br / > < br / > such a strong identification is inescapable , though not the same sort of career - wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys , like clayton more ( " the lone ranger " ) , george reeves ( " the adventures of superman " ) and charles nelson riley ( " uncle croc ' s block " ) . < br / > < br / > one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950 ' s tv screen to the 1990 ' s movie - going public is our collective memory . without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals , and their numbers were surely considerable ; even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times . it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles ; or even light years apart . < br / > < br / > so as not to be thought of as a totally square , old grouch please let ' s consider some other points . < br / > < br / > right here today , the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 , let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years , furthermore , i ' ve enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko ' 96 co - stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman . after all , it was the talents of guys like this and so many others , alumni of " nbc ; s saturday night " and " second city tv " that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing . but a bilko re - make ; it just didn ' t click . < br / > < br / > perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy ( always liked ' em ! ) but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby , old guys like me . < br / > < br / > so , we ' ve already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately , what ' s next ? howse about somebody doing hal roach ' s world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday & ames and tv ' s 1st cartoon series " crusader rabbit " ? remember where you heard it first ! poodle schnitz ! 
NEG director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past , like ' greedy ' and ' clue ' . this isn ' t one of them . more akin to a ' police academy ' film than its inspiration , it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors . but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act . nothing much happens , really . it ' s all quite dull . it ' s not very funny . martin , dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort , but they ' re all better than this and it ' s quite painful watching them work with such thin material . 
NEG un - bleeping - believable ! meg ryan doesn ' t even look her usual pert lovable self in this , which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick . hard to believe she was the producer on this dog . plus kevin kline : what kind of suicide trip has his career been on ? whoosh . . . banzai ! ! ! finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill ? must be a replay of jonestown - hollywood style . wooofff ! 
NEG this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it , surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff . just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time . and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this , or they were simply making it all up as they went along . ( * 1 / 2 ) 
NEG i don ' t remember seeing another murder / mystery movie as bad as this . this movie , about a medical examiner who investigates his friend ' s mysterious death in a car accident , has the complete receipt for a bad movie : bad acting , boring story , lack of suspense , poor humor and no drama . i remembered seeing this movie on pax , a tv station notable for dishing out low - budgeted and campy made - for - tv movies such as this one . tv movies , of course , do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen . but , this movie sure hit all sour tastes . the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making " receipe for murder " a great tv movie ; the title does offer some suspense . < br / > < br / > so , if you want a good recipe , don ' t watch this movie . this movie alone can kill your tv appetite . < br / > < br / > grade f 
NEG this collection really sucks ! < br / > < br / > i rented it , thinking i ´ d really would enjoy some good fighting . man this sucked ! quick flashy cuts , an extremely annoying speaker , and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened ( i ´ m thinking especially of jet li ´ s fight in fists of legend and jackie chan ´ s fight from drunken master 2 ) . < br / > < br / > and what ´ s the deal with those brawling streetfighters ? ! what ´ s so " cool " about that ? i ´ ve seen more interesting fights on martial law ! < br / > < br / > this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people . < br / > < br / > do not ever buy this film ! do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap ! < br / > < br / > instead , go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory ! 
NEG the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line , only to substitute with horrible special affects . this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children , but couldn ' t even accomplish that . many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies , but this movie is no where near that . fortunately this will be another film easily made , and easily forgotten . this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie . anyone who has a shred of respect for films , should avoid seeing this movie at all costs . 
NEG when i got this movie free from my job , along with three other similar movies . . i watched then with very low expectations . now this movie isn ' t bad per se . you get what you pay for . it is a tale of love , betrayal , lies , sex , scandal , everything you want in a movie . definitely not a hollywood blockbuster , but for cheap thrills it is not that bad . i would probably never watch this movie again . in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time , or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time . despite the bad acting , cliché lines , and sub par camera work . i didn ' t have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player . the story has been done many times in many movies . this one is no different , no better , no worse . < br / > < br / > just your average movie . 
NEG andy hardy meets debutante ( 1940 ) is the ninth ( 9th ) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into . characters andy hardy ( mickey rooney ) and judge hardy ( lewis stone ) were going to be front and center . the rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks . the series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in . < br / > < br / > lewis stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of judge hardy in a sympathetic manner . the rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do . mickey rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve . andys ' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way . even after he returned as a veteran of world war ii service in love laughs at andy hardy ( 1946 ) his reaction to any ' teapot tempest ' was the same , juvenile . < br / > < br / > in this film it is clearly illustrated . andy gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved . this screen writing device was known as the ' idiot plot ' . a means of stretching a poorly written scenario . maybe it was less mickey rooneys ' fault then the director and the writers . most likely george b . seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control rooneys ' excesses . to see our overview of the entire series go to you ' re only young once ( 1937 ) . 
NEG i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off , when watching it i got the chills , i even wet myself a little . when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time . any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being . some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past . this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr . norris mailbox . he can raise my kid i ' m not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life . 
NEG the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course ! it ' s a textbook example of how not to make a movie . watching the movie and then listening to the writer / director ' s commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them . call me old - fashioned , but i think of movies as a means of communication , and communication isn ' t complete if the audience doesn ' t know what the hell the director is talking about . the director ' s avowed purpose is to make a movie void of " hollywood conventions " . among those conventions , alas , is consistency of character and clarity of concept . the director himself realizes that audiences often don ' t understand points where he has purposely avoided a " hollywood cliché " . however , he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason . they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly . it ' s fine to avoid them , but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea , not simply eliminated . the film is built on an intriguing premise , rich with potential . two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of wwii . soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them . someone with less disdain for the " hollywood convention " of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea . this film certainly isn ' t it ! the puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters , but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script . in particular , i ' m becoming increasingly impressed by gonzo , who plays the lively corpse . in a number of muppet films , he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet . 
NEG gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes . < br / > < br / > i love 50 sci fi , i even love cheesy 50s sci fi , but this film is really , really bad . and not in a mst3k kinda way . < br / > < br / > virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best " hip cat " impression of abott & costello . < br / > < br / > chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi , such as in " cat women on the moon " but it can ' t in this case . this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature . < br / > < br / > that said , i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so . 
NEG living in the middle east ( in israel ) , i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana . having seen the trailer , and being a thriller - lover , i expected to see first of all a fast moving , breath catching movie , which wisely dips in global policy - making and the relation between oil , power and corruption , from a fresh angle . well , i almost left the movie in the middle . the pace was painfully slow , almost all characters were stereotyped , the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult , but , as steve rhodes wrote in his review , in the end you don ' t care . save your money , save your time , choose another movie . < br / > < br / > robi chernitsky 
NEG i saw the mst3k version of " deathstalker iii " and loved the movie so much - - even " unmystied " - - that i decided to watch the entire series of " deathstalker " films . i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh . < br / > < br / > nothing about " deathstalker i " was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it ! too much ugliness and nudity . i guess either " ds 3 " was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar , i . e . stupid and carefree and simple . i was wrong . even at $ 6 . 99 it seemed a waste of money . i didn ' t even open " ds 2 " as i will return it tomorrow . now i ' ll probably just throw away this dvd as i can ' t return it and no one wants it - - including myself ! so really , don ' t bother with this one . even the nudity ( lots of it , btw ) is uninspiring and icky . 
NEG i have seen and liked the original film , and expected more from a remake than this . < br / > < br / > good : effects and makeup are good . no complaints about the score and visuals , they are adequate , and the performances were okay ( tim roth was excellent , the other principals were fine , and a handful of the " supporting supporting actors " did very well with extremely limited roles ) . the action scenes were exciting and fun . < br / > < br / > bad : the escape from the ape city was terrible . the characters are going in circles , then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape . plus , what escape route leads through everybody ' s bedroom ? < br / > < br / > the story was pared down to include as much action as possible . i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect . < br / > < br / > finally , the ending was completely nonsensical as presented . without seeing the inevitable sequel , there is no justification for it . < br / > < br / > 
NEG if there ' s one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film , it ' s seeing it done by experienced film - makers who ought to know better . this " re - imagining " of planet of the apes could have used some imagination , to say nothing of essential elements of character development . nova , the girl in the original planet of the apes , was a better developed character than daena in this version , for all that she does not say a single word . one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton , a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence , wit and humour , all of which were notably absent from this production . < br / > < br / > there were problems in basic plot development . the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk . this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made * all * the difference in the original film . even while he was mute , his ability to communicate was what marked out heston ' s taylor as being different from the other humans . in the current film , mark wahlberg encourages the ( talking ) human slaves to revolt , but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already . they are dexterous tool - users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans , something mute humans can ' t do . it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them . indeed , since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre - technology era without ( at first ) any gadgets to help him , it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage , not the humans who are used to living there . < br / > < br / > it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg . her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth . < br / > < br / > the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act , at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson ( wahlberg ) , and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung - ho freedom - fighter . this was poor character development . ( estella warren , in particular , looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script ) . wahlberg ' s puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me , as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout . < br / > < br / > creating the apes : half a plus point and two minuses : ape make - up was excellent on the males , particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes ( which was why he was so good in the green mile ) , and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully . but the ape females looked like nothing on earth , neither ape nor human . the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordon ' s rocket : jumping apes looked as if they ' d just been fired from a catapult , they had none of the long - limbed grace of genuine apes . secondly , the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal , probably feline , making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic . < br / > < br / > in the original film , the various " human " things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ( " i never knew an ape i didn ' t like . " " human see , human do ! " ) . here , the apes just talk matter - of - factly exactly as 21st century humans do , and there is no humour in it at all . the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feet . < br / > < br / > nothing made me cringe more than the " v - ger from star trek " moment near the end of the film . first of all , the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past , for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form . secondly , the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away , something any ape could have done centuries ago . this moment was , for me , far worse than the much - maligned ending of the movie . < br / > < br / > things of that nature , however , are typical of most science fiction movies of today . back in the ' 60s and ' 70s , they generally didn ' t have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets , but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional . i ' m thinking of 2001 : a space odyssey , the 1967 planet of the apes , thx1138 , soylent green , silent running and the 1972 solaris . the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time . however , this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going : space storms , anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek ; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes ( in reality from any one planet , all other bodies , even their own moons , are just points of light ) ; a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years ; two - thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button . to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door . in a contemporary setting , you ' d have to explain * why * it was bullet proof , but because it ' s " science fiction " you don ' t have to ! < br / > < br / > overall , burton ' s most disappointing film . 
NEG there ' s nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland , and robot wars does deliver . sure , the acting is lousy , the dialogue is sub - par , and the characters are one - dimensional , but it has giant robots ! the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period . they are certainly not as polished as today ' s standards , but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures , so it has aged fairly well . its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime , and it does have a certain tongue - in - cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable . i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci - fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction . 
NEG did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads . like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks , next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider , next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes . i can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work . < br / > < br / > i also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie . i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie . if , however , you find his work / not funny then i would recommend staying away from this one . 
NEG this was a new alltime low among westerns . the writing is excruciatingly bad , characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland , the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed . and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent , sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism . ' ride with the devil ' is among my five worst movie experiences ever , a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect . 
NEG this film should have never been made . honestly , i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts . the director is not a great actress , though she did a lot of movies in holland , and the young woman who took the main part is a tv - personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self - criticism . the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better , he did not convince me than . to start with the the story , i have not read the novel it is based upon , but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon , not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie . something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues , it was most of the time spoken out loud . my regards go to the cameraman , at least he tried to make something out of it . it is a pity that the film is edited lousy , if not , some scenes were certainly more credible . 
NEG richard dreyfuss is , indeed , in this flick , but in a rather small part . he is not the " obsessed " filmmaker - he ' s the group ' s business manager / accountant . even the box describes the film inaccurately . there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke , as advertised , unless one uses the term " erotic " quite loosely . i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character . i might have , however , had i realized that the famous 60 ' s anthem , leonard cohen ' s " suzanne , " was an artistic influence . other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of james joyce ' s " ulysses " , and an interesting visual reference to the end of ingmar bergman ' s " the seventh seal , " i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like " last year at marianbad " and " un chien andalou . " if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe , there are many superior films , ranging from " bye , bye , brasil " to " cecil b . demented . " 
NEG mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke . you have no idea what ' s happening on the screen with the irritating theme song " suzanne " being played over and over throughout the movie until when " the second coming of suzanne " is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing . < br / > < br / > this off - the - wall armature movie maker logan , jared martin , is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project . planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne , sandra locke , who reminds him of someone he knew in another life : jesus christ . < br / > < br / > with logan ' s assistant and all around gofer clavius , richard dreyfuss , somehow getting a $ 740 , 000 . 00 loan from the bank to finance logan ' s masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film . this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon , paul sand , but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out . < br / > < br / > the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub - plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy , kari avalos , who ' s cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else , at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to , failed . it ' s not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there ; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she , like jesus , could miraculously heal the sick ? < br / > < br / > there ' s also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair , gene barry , who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid - life crisis or has seen a biblical - like vision that changed his life forever . sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it ' s all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there ' s all this suffering in the world , like this movie that he ' s in , and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne . sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david , mark rasmusser , who ' s gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast . < br / > < br / > the movie " the second coming of suzanne " goes on with a number of unrelated sequences , probably to fill or pad in some time by it ' s director and film editor , and then goes to it ' s final scene in a christ - like crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling . it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate , on the helpless and tied up suzanne , the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2 , 000 years ago . < br / > < br / > hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow " the second coming of suzanne " puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film . the movie tries to be arty but that ' s just an excuse to cover up it ' s brainless and non - existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it . 
NEG there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film . it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time . the acting is horrible , the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn ' t seem sure on which way to take this film . " a buddy film , " " an action / comedy , " " mystery . " seems half way through , he gives up , and is just along for the ride . jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers . it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie . jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this , had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit . mr . morita had already been a star in his own right , acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as " happy days , " and the dismal but affable " mr . t and tina . " and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film , " midway , " " the karate kid , " and a host of others . mr . leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s . and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america . he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films . it is a shame , that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense . 
NEG well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview , else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie . i mean haven ' t we had enough of this yet ? scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious ! the plot sucks , and the acting is the worst i ' ve seen . ( only godzilla can compare , which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i ' ve seen in the cinema with this one . ) < br / > < br / > there is so many plot holes in the story , and the girls are so alike , that you don ' t even now who has been killed , and who has not . ( and you don ' t care . ) the only of them i knew in advance was denise , and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie . < br / > < br / > stay as far away from this movie as possible . ( 2 / 10 ) 
NEG following the success of the ( awful ) gilligan ' s island tv movie reruns , a number of tv movies were made in the 1980 ' s reuniting casts from classic shows . most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special . the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy - type comedy style that really wasn ' t in the original series . yvonne de carlo , a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series , is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode . and since the roles of " eddie " and " marilyn " in this movie are nothing more than cameos , what was the point of making them younger and recasting them ? with very little rewriting , they could have used butch patrick and pat priest . although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch , i didn ' t enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there ' s too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters ( ironically that very year , 1981 , caesar ' s old partner in comedy , imogene coca , was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies ) . another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum . why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a " typical " ( if strange ) american family , not famous monsters ? this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles , there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980 ' s with a completely new cast and a 1990 ' s tv movie which featured decarlo , lewis , priest , and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining . 
NEG dear friends and family , < br / > < br / > i guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen , then that ' s their eternal damnation - just remember kids , " birth control " doesn ' t mean " oral sex " , i don ' t care what the honor student says . on the other hand , even if the senator ' s aid quotes himself as a " bit of a romantic guy " , he ' s still only hitting on a high school girl . if she was my sister , i ' d eat this guys kneecaps . < br / > < br / > other than that i found out that mongolians don ' t kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named zoo like delicate undergarments . < br / > < br / > i think i ' d almost rather watch richie rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip , slap , slop . thank you , and good night . 
NEG an absolutely wretched waste of film ! ! nothing ever happens . no ghosts , hardly any train , no mystery , no interest . the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful . everything else is pathetic . the premise is idiotic : a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no - place , because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes . what ? and the railroad leaves them no place to stay , in a heavy storm ? i think not . oh , they can walk 4 miles across the dead - black fields . umm , yeah . sure . or , they can force themselves on the railroad ' s hospitality , and stay at the ' haunted ' train station . a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring , utterly without ghosts , interest , or plot . < br / > < br / > so very terribly dull that this seems impossible . < br / > < br / > this ought to be added to the lost films list ! ! aargh ! ! 
NEG arthur askey ' s great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public . his juvenile jokes , silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world . a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him , and he was never completely comfortable in films . he has his moments in the ghost train , and his character , tommy gander , has been tailored to make the most of his talents , but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated . < br / > < br / > askey ' s support in the film is not strong , it includes regular co - star richard murdoch ; betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple ; linden travers going over the top as a ' mad woman ' . also on board are peter murray - hill , who off - screen married phyllis calvert , as the nominal leading man , giving a totally bland reading of the part , and leading lady carol lynne , who turns in an equally insipid performance . it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham ' s brandy . 
NEG not really spoilers in my opinion , but i wanted to cover myself , nevertheless . as the executive producer , morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less , a movie with an intentional indie - feel , and just be absorbed in the mentor / be - all - that - you - can - be theme . he plays a alternate universe , semi - washed up version of the real morgan freeman , who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson , ca from brentwood to research his next movie role . why carson , is a mystery to so . cal residents . he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements . paz vega is pretty to watch , a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz , playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman ' s research . his character is only known as " him " to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people - " psst , that ' s ' him , ' etc . unfortunately , i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood , carried no cash or debit card , or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him . if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does , then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has . nothing really happens in this movie . i don ' t believe that either of the main character ' s were substantially changed by their encounter with each other . it flirts with the idea of adultery , but then that thought fizzles . this to me was similar to steve martin ' s shopgirl , without the sexual affair . it was self - indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience . 
NEG i rented the dubbed - english version of lensman , hoping that since it came from well - known novels it would have some substance . while there were hints of substance in the movie , it mostly didn ' t rise above the level of kiddie cartoon . maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book , or it lost a lot in the dubbed version . or maybe even the source novels were lightweight . but for whatever reason , there wasn ' t much there . < br / > < br / > i noticed lots of details that were derivative , sloppy , poorly dramatized , or otherwise deficient . some examples : the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 " star gate " scene and the star wars image of hyperspace . the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized " r2 - d2 " . < br / > < br / > it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars , but mercifully ( since the humor doesn ' t work ) gives up on comedy and plays it serious . in that sense , it ' s superior to the star wars franchise , which started with a clever sense of humor , and eventually deteriorated to jar - jar ' s annoying silliness . < br / > < br / > the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm . the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field , dumping silage onto unharvested crops , rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already - harvested rows or into a truck . corn ( maize ) was pouring out the grain chute , but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field . < br / > < br / > when it was time for kim ' s father had to face his fate , there wasn ' t any dramatic weight to the scene . that could have been partly the fault of the english - language voice actor , but the drawings didn ' t show much weight either . kim ' s reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing . < br / > < br / > similarly , when a character named henderson was killed , chris showed very little reaction , even though they were apparently supposed to have been close . ( henderson ' s death is no spoiler ; his name isn ' t revealed until his death scene . ) she seems to promptly forget him . someone ' s expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does . i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case ; there ' s at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris . < br / > < br / > on several occasions , villains fail to accomplish their orders . a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths . i can ' t say whether that ' s lifted from star wars , or if that comes from an earlier source - - possibly the lensman books . < br / > < br / > there ' s a scene where a space ship crash - lands . as it plunges toward the ground , parts are break off the ship . but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands . < br / > < br / > while in most cases chris seems like a competent , tough space hero , there ' s a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress . someone tough enough to get over henderson ' s death so quickly should at least be able to shout , " help , it ' s got me and i can ' t reach my gun ! " instead of just shrieking . < br / > < br / > the character with the most personality ( almost too much at times ) is d . j . bill . he sounded like wolfman jack , the d . j . in american graffiti . i wonder if he ' s as well - voiced in the original language . < br / > < br / > two planets in the movie exploded . the explosions were unimpressive , and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars . to its credit , however , the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star ' s primary weapon . the dialog had a good , interesting explanation for the cause . many other explosions in the movie did look good , just not the planetary explosions . < br / > < br / > some of the sound effects are very cheesy , as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game . some of the images look like primitive video games , and some influence from tron is visible too . on the other hand , the sound effects are often pretty decent , although that emphasizes the cheesy - sounding parts . the art is good too , particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy - looking computer graphics . < br / > < br / > finally , there ' s the story . if a movie tells a good story , it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings . but the plot here was pretty lightweight . a naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship , and acquires a great power he doesn ' t understand . he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful , unredeemably evil enemy . he makes friends , learns about his special power , and grows into a young man . if he is persistent and virtuous enough , he might even defeat the evil enemy . details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline , but there ' s very little more than that in this movie . < br / > < br / > in the end , it ' s just a kiddie cartoon . but then , since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children , maybe it doesn ' t need to be anything more than that . 
NEG oh dear . some of the best talent in british tv made this serial , and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure , and had to settle for first takes of many scenes . < br / > < br / > there are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery ( mostly when the " monster " attacks and we see it from his point of view ) , but i ' m afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny ! such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course : oh look , there ' s a hand . . . oh , and there ' s another hand over there . . . hmm this is a bit puzzling . . . < br / > < br / > for many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd , but the bbc always said no . now i think i understand why ! 
NEG well ! what can one say ? firstly , this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours , for the complexity ( or lack of such ) of the plot . the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available . swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all . after seeing sean connery ' s interpretation of the great man in " the league of extraordinary gentlemen " , swayzee really does not make the grade . this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength , stature , subtlety , or humour needed for the part , and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor , who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast . some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography . for example . when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert , their tracks are visible down to the oasis , just waiting for them to walk in them . climbing out of the mine leads to an exit ( on the next shot ) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through , et cetera . i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment . in some ways i wish he had . < br / > < br / > the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything . < br / > < br / > swayzee does quite well as the sad father , returned to london , who is unable to obtain the custody of his son . swayzee should stick to that sort of thing . he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart , experience of life , and sense of fair play . < br / > < br / > 4 out of 10 . barely 
NEG i give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of africa . the rest was . . . well pretty boring . for about 50min we have the outline of the plot . . . in war of the worlds , the introductory part lasted , oh , about 10min ? then was real action ! this is something like : " let ' s take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets ! " . and maybe deliver a message , like " don ' t kill elephants ! " . very ecological . i would have expected this out of a " new " steven segal movie , not from this . . . the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun - tan , dyed hair and too much foundation ! and i didn ' t see one scene where her hair is messed up , or she sweats , or her clothes are dusty . she just doesn ' t look like a 19 century woman ! and in the bar , where they seek up our hero , swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like dracula . hmmm , bram stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 , and it became famous in the next years . livingstone and other explorers went to central africa from 1840 to 1880 . so unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 . . houston , we have a problem . : ) swayze makes a nice impression . . as a nutshell - hard on the outside , but soft and cuddly on the inside . not that i would cuddle with a nut , but you get the point . he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions . the movie stank . way too long and increasingly boring . don ' t watch it ! don ' t buy it ! it ' s a waste of your money ! 
NEG i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts . actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities . anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster . i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average . i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler . 
NEG this kind of film has become old hat by now , hasn ' t it ? the whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop . < br / > < br / > it sure sounds like a good idea : a great ensemble cast , some good gags , and some human drama about what could have / might have been . unfortunately , there is no central event that binds them all together , like there was in " the big chill " , one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one . you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone . the superficiality this creates is not just annoying , it ' s maddening . the below - average script doesn ' t help . 
NEG i really have problems rating this movie . it is directed brilliantly , there is obviously a lot of money in it . gere and danes are intense ( although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up ) , editing and cinematography are excellent . on the other hand , it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes , and , yes , one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire . < br / > < br / > in purely artistic terms , it is a 9 , but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie . . . . 
NEG in the title i write that the story is ludicrous . below i ' ll elaborate and tell you why it , in my humble opinion , ruins this movie . < br / > < br / > gere and danes are doing their jobs , and while it ' s not their best work , it ' s quite ok . the rest of the cast , though , is doing a really poor job . mind you , this is not entirely the actors fault . the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth . all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth , or the character is such a cliché that it doesn ' t matter how hard the actors try . < br / > < br / > the director has a bit of a se7en complex , but looking merely at the direction , i think he does an ok job . < br / > < br / > but the story . this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways . first of all it ' s a bad movie script . the characters are shallow ( except for gere ' s and danes ' characters ) , the villains are clichés and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable . besides this , the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years . it ' s the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals , regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them . it ' s also the kind of movie that says , albeit only between the lines , that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial , judge or jury . and of course , according to the movie , everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance . < br / > < br / > so , if you ' re going to film school and need an example of a bad script , or if you ' re writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost . see it . for everyone else , i recommend another movie . 
NEG you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers . < br / > < br / > i ' m sorry , but spielberg didn ' t deserve to win any oscar for this piece , and i think the academy was right in that vote . ( other oscars for best actor nominations and such . . . that i don ' t know about . but it would be hard to justify , given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product . ) the way spielberg directs this is so contrived , so meddlesome . while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me : " sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered . sentimentality is sugary and unreal , a false view of life . " this is over - the - top sentimentality . when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity , as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found ? there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film : all the men crowding around miss millie ' s car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away ; harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he ' s working on ( a cheap slapstick gag ) ; the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel , as if magically entranced by the choir ' s singing . . . on and on . nothing rings true . i even wondered if harpo ' s name was chosen purposefully because it ' s his wife sophia ' s real name , " oprah , " backwards . spielberg isn ' t above such " cuteness . " < br / > < br / > it ' s not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion . schindler ' s list was amazing , deeply touching for me , and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism , even if the story is a bit contrived . 
NEG lorne michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies . < br / > < br / > you ' d think that after such dismal flicks " superstar " , " night at the roxbury " , and " coneheads " , he ' d start to get the notion that maybe he doesn ' t know what he ' s doing when it comes to movies ( and many would argue that he doesn ' t know what he ' s doing when it comes to television , as well ) . trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on snl makes no sense . < br / > < br / > i personally like tim meadows , and think that he would be great in the right movie . it ' s a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation , and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene . any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad , not because it ' s funny . < br / > < br / > oh well , at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired snl characters who will never have films done about them . it ' s just too bad that this one made it to the big screen . 
NEG this may very well be the worst movie i ' ll see if i live to be 100 . i think a group of first - graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this . i ' m dumber for having watched it , and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film . < br / > < br / > and after i finally turned it off , i actually had the urge to vomit . < br / > < br / > no one had a clue about photography when made this . no one had a clue about acting . no one had a clue about just about anything . < br / > < br / > i can ' t believe f / x shows this crap on occasion . the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz ! channels - not even the main one . and it was on at about 3 a . m . at that . 
NEG . . . was so that i could , in good conscience , tell everyone how horrible this movie is . i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself , " wow , this is pretty bad . " . and , to be honest , i would ' ve given this movie 1 star if it wasn ' t for esai morales ( though he had very little screen time ) . he ' s the movie ' s only well - acted role , which is a shame because i really like gil bellows . . . or at least i thought i did . < br / > < br / > while watching this i started thinking back to his part in " shawshank redemption " and realized it wasn ' t as good as i thought it was . problem : his jail - house / tough guy act seems like it ' s just that , an act ; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression . has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to ? i doubt it , but maybe he should have . < br / > < br / > and , to make matters worse , they ' ve managed to inject a little jail - house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived , especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a " rasta " who ' s accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural . < br / > < br / > i wouldn ' t normally slam a movie like this , but when i saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review . i felt like i was cheated and lied to , and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie . < br / > < br / > i say boooooooo . 
NEG i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family . this movie could have been so much more . the trouble ? it was set during the big action movie craze . i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing . i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause . yes it had funny scenes ( or laughable ) though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes . if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge . < br / > < br / > i give this movie a low number . it may not have been this low if i had not read the book . 
NEG ( 48 out of 278 people found this comment useful , and counting . . . ) < br / > < br / > people are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow " idealism " that lurks behind communism . che ' s charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda ( such as this movie ) about him . < br / > < br / > i don ' t know what ' s worse : being captured by one of che ' s murder - squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically soderberghian garbage . the question isn ' t why this pet - project was made but what took them so long . by " them " i ' m referring , of course , to left - wing hollywood and its " secret " love of marxist tyrants ( lenin , castro . . . take your pick ) . i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown ' s least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project . where was oliver stone all these years ? robert redford ? tim robbins ? warren beatty ? alan pakula ? george clooney ? barbra streisand even ? it ' s a mystery . all these overrated " artists " have often indulging themselves in similar , politically one - sided projects , yet somehow che guevara , who is arguably the most popular and well - known communist , hasn ' t been a film topic of theirs yet . < br / > < br / > " guerrilla " has all the hallmarks of an american truth - bending story of an epic scale ; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big - budget political fairy - tale bios such as " malcolm x " or " gandhi " , i . e . almost none . the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary . nevertheless , however controversial and criminal this man ' s actions may have been , one thing nobody could take away from him : he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why del toro fits the bill only visually . del toro may be an interesting , charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically , but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever , hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive . casting such mediocrities as bratt , philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director ' s lack of sound judgment . < br / > < br / > the movie is to the most part extremely slow ( no surprise there ) , and visually uninteresting . even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3 - hour mark , so it ' s quite telling that this soderbergh , who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career , would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task . if you think the film ' s length indicates that a bulk of che ' s life has been shown here - then think again . soderbergh focuses on che ' s last phase , and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense , full of guevara ' s alleged idealism . ( psychopaths don ' t have ideals . ) i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che ' s earlier life . did he actually consider it too uninteresting ? a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer , huh ? amazing . some much better directors than this over - praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4 - hour movie . < br / > < br / > soderbergh , in a sense , becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative , dark side - which is more than 90 % - of guevara . by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy , consciously ignoring the ugly truth ( god forbid he should taint the holy image of che ) , soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite : that he cares only about ideas , never about the people on whom these ideas are tested ( like on guinea pigs ) . soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind ; such people often have a latent contempt for the " proleteriat " ( what a stupid term ) they ' re supposedly siding with . < br / > < br / > half of all students around the world wear che ' s image on their red and orange shirts , but without ever knowing why . he has become an iconic figure for clueless , uninformed , very often young people , who think that by having this man ' s face on their chest that somehow makes them appear " edgy " , intellectual , hip or interesting . in reality , wearing a che shirt only underlines one ' s overall shallowness and total disinterest in self - education . ( wouldn ' t you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his / her face to the world ? ) wearing che ' s by - now cliché image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup . all those " che - wearers " probably know more about marge ' s blue hair than they ' ll ever read up on about fidel castro ' s dead ally . < br / > < br / > after everything that ' d been done in the name of marx , one would think that these mongrel " ideals " would be finally laid to rest . it seems mankind will never learn . stalin , mao , kim il , pol pot , castro , milosevic , ceausescu , the iron curtain , a hundred million dead , more than a billion ruined physically and / or mentally through this system . . . so none of that matters , huh ? < br / > < br / > the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work - and vote . hint : sean penn headed a jury not long ago . < br / > < br / > for my music - related rants , go to : http : / / rateyourmusic . com / collection / fedor8 / 
NEG i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations . i had seen jacquet ' s previous movie ( march of the penguins ) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio . however , i was severely disappointed . most of all , this movie is terribly boring . literally nothing happens . i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend , and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like " well then the winter comes , and then spring , and then there ' s an eagle , and a river , and one time it is dark , and the girl goes into a cave , and another time the fox has babies " and so on . after about half an hour i began sighing , yawning , rolling my eyes , cursing the reviewer at the radio station , and hoping that it would be over soon . but the movie went on and on . when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking . the most annoying parts of the movie are ( a ) the girl , who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with . she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie ( one year ) , and shows exactly two facial expressions : joy and seriousness . she is cute , no question about that . however , a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all - too - human presence . i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear , drown in the river , or something similarly terrible . ( b ) the commentary by the girl ' s adult voice , which tells us nothing but negligible , obvious , boring , redundant things . ( c ) the music , which is desperately lacking subtlety . when the girl is happily jumping around , the music jumps around , too . when the fox is threatened by an eagle , the music becomes threatening , too . it reminded me of the very early days of film - making , and was just too predictable to enjoy . admittedly , many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it , at least they got somehow involved . thus , my warning concerns adults only : if you are over ten years old , avoid this movie . you can get a better ( and cheaper ) sleep in most other places . 
NEG extremities < br / > < br / > aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 < br / > < br / > sound format : mono < br / > < br / > a woman turns the tables on a would - be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home , and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police , in which case he could be released and attack her again . < br / > < br / > exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough ' n ' ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman ( 1978 ) will almost certainly be disappointed by extremities . true , farrah fawcett ' s character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker ( a suitably slimy james russo ) , but scriptwriter william mastrosimone and director robert m . young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production . would their final solution hold up in a court of law ? maybe . . . < br / > < br / > based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance , the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action . acing and technical credits are fine , though fawcett ' s overly subdued performance won ' t play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation . 
NEG bad movie - saw it at the tiff and the movie gives me a sense of ' been there done that ' - it reminds me alot of the movie blow - expect the blow was actually interesting . < br / > < br / > this one story told two ways and both times it is not told that well . < br / > < br / > 
NEG val kilmer , solid performance . dylan mcdermott , solid performance . josh lucas , solid performance . three very engaging actors giving decent performances . the problem is , who cares about the plot ? john holmes . infamous for his well - endowments , a drug addict , and a guy who , despite contracting aids , continued to make adult films , just does not make an intriguing character . < br / > < br / > the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80 ' s in los angelos to which holmes was linked , arrested and charged with murder , and who ultimately was acquitted . just like in the case of o . j . , the guilt factor , regardless of the outcome , ranged quite high in the " he did it " zone . < br / > < br / > there is no one to sympathize with in this film , as everyone is a self - serving criminal . there is just nothing remotely interesting here . 
NEG my husband and i went to see this movie , being the horror movie buffs that we are . two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back . i was so disappointed . the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film . there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances , etc . i found most of the ' scary ' parts to be more comical than anything . after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers , i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us . my advice : if you are a fan of true horror movies , save yourself the pain of sitting through this one . i can ' t really say that i would recommend renting it either , unless you have a free rental coming to you . 
NEG well , i bought the zombie bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun . that ' s what it is , without the fun . this film truly is mindless , it is absent of any plot or character development , or any sort of storyline . the basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore . basically , every kill looks exactly the same . zombies ripping someone apart . yeah , that ' s okay , but you need some original kills too . i mean it got really lame , every kill looked exactly the same , filmed exactly the same way . thats what killed me . i love gore , and the gore in this film did nothing for me . it was just boring . no storyline , just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person . i wanted to like this movie , too . i love shot on video gore movies . . . like redneck zombies . but i couldn ' t kid myself . this film has it ' s good points , but none of those are in the film . i understand that many of the " zombies " helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies , which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world . but overall , this is a terrible film . 
NEG man , what a scam this turned out to be ! not because it wasn ' t any good ( as i wasn ' t really expecting anything from it ) but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its " stars " as being stuart whitman , stella stevens and tony bill . sure enough , their names did not appear in the film ' s opening credits , much less themselves in the rest of it ! ! as it turned out , the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady ( 1975 )  but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody ' s guess < br / > < br / > even so , since i paid $ 1 . 50 for its rental and i was in a monster - movie mood anyhow , i elected to watch the movie regardless and , yup , it stunk ! apart from the fact that it had a no - name cast and an anonymous crew , an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws - like pretensions and , intentionally so , at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts - cum - boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on . the creature itself  a plesiosaur i . e . half - dinosaur / half - fish  is imperfectly realized ( naturally ) but , as had been the case with the giant claw ( 1957 ) which i ' ve also just seen , this didn ' t seem to bother the film - makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can , especially during the movie ' s second half ! 
NEG i ' m a big fan of the old westerns , and do not believe that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory . but not even ronda fleming and stewart granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy . fallen but virtuous woman , bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation , etc . i can ' t help but notice the last names of the writer and young " actor " who plays granger ' s son . any nepotism there ? i ' ve seen better acting in high school plays . chill wills plays a cartoon characterization of chill wills . have i reached the 1000 words yet ? 
NEG i watched the malayalam movie " boeing boeing " made in 1985 ( which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name ) long back . the basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way , the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies ( probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience ) . . . < br / > < br / > i haven ' t seen the english original . but had really enjoyed the malayalam film ( made by priyadarshan himself ) which was a side splitting comedy , back then . of course the acting by mohanlal , mukesh and sukumari ( who did the cook ' s role ) was so natural and spontaneous . < br / > < br / > probably , i am too smitten by the malayalam film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake . but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have overacted . paresh rawal has done a decent job - but doesn ' t reach anywhere near sukumari . < br / > < br / > but all in all its ok , if one compares it to other recent hindi comedy movies . 
NEG . . . . and after seeing this pile of crap you won ' t be surprised that it wasn ' t published < br / > < br / > ! ! ! ! spoilers ! ! ! ! < br / > < br / > this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it ' s one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : < br / > < br / > " my god . what happened here ? " < br / > < br / > " i don ' t know but they sure hate cats " * < br / > < br / > the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you ' re going to be watching a bad movie < br / > < br / > the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it ' s very illogical and confused . we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town ? having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - that ' s the only thing we learn . we never learn how they ' re able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator . monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . i guess that ' s so the production team can come up with an ending . it was that they started the movie my complaint lies < br / > < br / > we ' re treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis , clive barker and even stephen king make cameos . i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they weren ' t going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . that ' s how bad sleepwalkers is < br / > < br / > * unbelievable as it seems that wasn ' t the worst line in the movie . the worst line is - " that cat saved my life " 
NEG this was a " cute " movie at first , then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs , at best . < br / > < br / > there is too much king james english spoken with is not only annoying in today ' s world but not always easy to interpret . can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film ? forget it . < br / > < br / > bing crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as " hank martin . " rhonda fleming ( " alisande la carteloise " ) was , too , in addition to her good looks and beautiful , long red hair . < br / > < br / > it ' s a nice movie with a feel - good ending , and i can ' t knock that . maybe this is worthy of a rental , for historical sake or if you ' re a big crosby fan but , overall , it ' s not that much . 
NEG i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further . < br / > < br / > nothing about this film worked , absolutely nothing . delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex - jailbird . at the same time her friend hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her . she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her . then there ' s delmar ' s brother jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict , missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father . on the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends , one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film . so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life , death , grief and love in the first half , the film simply loses direction . < br / > < br / > if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed . for instance , why does delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money , especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife ? why is hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn ' t love her ? how is it missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight ? is jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems , or is missy the exception ? has delmar and jethro ' s mother always been on the eccentric side , or is it a more recent development ? why is jethro so keen on cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room ? why did moses spend years in prison for stealing a car , a relatively minor crime ? how does delmar manage to end up giving birth to moses ' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex ? < br / > < br / > these questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered . i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script . big mistake . losing several subplots especially the hortense and marlon story , which adds nothing to the overall film , would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the delmar , jethro and moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else . < br / > < br / > add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all , including jorja fox who does her best to rise above the material . i ' m not surprised that this appears to have been the director ' s last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story . 
NEG preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings , assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered . < br / > < br / > film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood , with a tongue - in - cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses ( . . looking for a way up the ladder ) and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight . brian krause , who i thought was dreadful , overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced , portrays the loud , temperamental director who doesn ' t like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer , alison ( . . played by dahlia salem ) seem to be taking over the production . andrew moxham is paul parsons , who is the brother of a victim from the first film . the film ' s dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it ' s worth . nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty , with stanley as clever as ever , using his brains to commandeer a film production , killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work , letting no one stand in his way . . that is until alison realizes who stanley really is . alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject . . what motivated stanley to kill , why would he do such a thing , and what led such a man down this dark path ? the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller . of course , you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley , with a really ridiculous , unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer ' s fate ( . . quite a hard pill to swallow ) . unlike the first film , which was photographed with sophisticated polish , director po - chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed ( . . such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles , slow - motion in a sepia color , and several instances which are captured on video ) and rather annoy instead of impress . this sequel , to me , just wasn ' t on target as much as the original , with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious . 
NEG from the start , you know this is a sam sherman film more than an al adamson film because as the credits roll , " a sam sherman production " appears in letters as big as the title credit . not only that , mr . sherman co - wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use bob livingstone , a washed - up , 69 year old western star of the old hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of " swinging stewardesses " . < br / > < br / > now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft - core exploitation feature ? it defies explanation , but that is sam sherman for you . his obsession with old hollywood colored a lot of his films for independent international pictures , and he and al adamson frequently tried to get has - been actors for their films ( e . g . j . carrol naish , russ tamblyn , lon chaney jr . , etc . ) . but bob livingstone ? tell me the drive - in demographic knew who this ' 40 ' s second - rater was ; it ' s ridiculous ! < br / > < br / > but then again , " naughty stewardesses " was a successful picture for them , so we can ' t just write this off as a sherman fiasco . still , by any aesthetic standard , it ' s an incoherent mess . al adamson wanted out of this picture , and it is easy to see why . first off , it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core ( tits and ass / simulated sex only ) to a kidnapping thriller ( shades of steckler ' s " rat pfink and boo boo " ! ) in between , we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around vegas to the hackneyed music of sparrow , or richard smedley and connie hoffmann on a photo shoot in san francisco . worst of all , we get bob livingstone as a jack lalanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy . . . gag ! ( thankfully , his big sex scene with connie hoffmann was deleted , but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the dvd in the special features section . creepy . ) < br / > < br / > this is a terrible , terrible movie , but i ' ll give it three stars for gary graver ' s photography and out of sympathy to connie hoffmann for having to make it with " wrinkles " livingstone . " naughty stewardesses " is for al adamson completists and / or scholars of exploitation film as sam sherman ' s commentary offers vital inside info . all others , beware . 
NEG i watched ' envy ' two nights ago , on dvd , at a friends house . the premise of this film is quite promising , jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential , but it completely fails to deliver . i watched it with about five friends and no - one laughed for the entire film . the jokes ( which are few and far between ) are not funny in any way . . . the story line is crap , and they never answer the question . . . where does the sh * t go ? of course the answer to that is no one cares . this film lacks any sort of comedy value , and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j - man . none of the characters are developed , the plots so thin it ' s nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny ? ? 
NEG i usually like comedy movies . i really enjoy them . but i don ' t really get the point of " envy " . i mean , it has a dull content / topic , and it ' s not really funny . < br / > < br / > although the acting is generally good , it ' s not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting . stiller and black don ' t show all their talent in this movie . < br / > < br / > so , if you ' re about to rent a comedy , i suggest you definitely don ' t go for this one . unless you want to get bored , and i can see i ' m not the only one with this opinion , because even jack black apologized for it ( take a look at trivia ) . 
NEG start with the script . i have seen cartoons with more depth than " envy " . anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen , and was not funny the first time , a movie is in deep trouble , which " envy " certainly is . a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it . here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere . christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb , because his character is so weak . ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies , " flirting with disaster " , and " duplex " , immediately come to mind . be certain that " envy " is not a black comedy . there are no double meanings , just total nonsense . " envy " deserves it ' s low rating , because like it ' s subject matter , it stinks . - merk 
NEG well , i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kira ' s sex scenes , but unfortunately i did not see much of them . all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies - it just doesn ' t look much like two people having sex . there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - kira ' s new lover is a killer . whoa ! ! ! how shocking ! ! ! why don ' t we nominate this movie for oscar award ? i can ' t imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r - rated ( mine is imported from uk , rated 18 ) . conclusion ? put it down and walk away , so yon won ' t end up with being a moron like me . < br / > < br / > score : 2 / 10 
NEG schizophreniac : the whore mangler is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an " extreme " horror film . any sort of acting , production , storyline , fx , etc . . . go out the window in an effort to create " shock - value " . now don ' t get me wrong - i consider myself a connoisseur of " shock " films , and the sleazier / gorier / nastier the better - but it ' s still nice to see some sort of talent from someone involved in the film . < br / > < br / > schizophreniac chronicles the life of harry russo - a drug - addicted freak - show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist ' s dummy , rubberneck . he goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people , and screaming about how much he hates " hoo - uhs " ( that ' s " whores " for those of you that don ' t speak new york - ese . . . ) and how he wants to rape them in the ass . there are a few weak necrophilia scenes , very little gore , and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you haven ' t seen in a better film . . . < br / > < br / > the only redeeming thing that i can find in this retarded film are the often ( unintentionally ? ) hilarious screaming - fits from our main man , harry . he goes on - and - on - and - on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass , and it really becomes quite comical after a while . in fact , i ' m almost tempted to believe that there ' s supposed to be some sort of homo - erotic undertone to this film , with all the ass talk and constant shots of harry running around with his dong hangin ' out . in all honesty , that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some t - and - a ( and some full - frontal , for good measure ) . schizophreniac is mildly amusing as a 1 - time watch , but i can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called schizophreniac : the whore mangler . to be honest - the title , by far - is the best thing about this trash . . . a generous 3 . 5 / 10 
NEG the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood . even john ford never made that many with so much quality . the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are . ford ' s my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them . or at least two . < br / > < br / > the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase . chase being responsible for the brilliant red river . chase wrote far country , bend of the river , and probably some others . but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine , but then very few films , western or otherwise are . < br / > < br / > each of the five films of mann have huge gaps , or is it six , lets see . bend , far , man of the west , furies , winchester 73 , and yep , six , naked spur . each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene , with fairly glaring lapses . yet so does red river , which is still the single greatest western ever made . so perfection isn ' t everything . < br / > < br / > but the far country has huge , huge holes . it ' s mawkish , and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns . the rest is pretty pedestrian , with the usual exception of mann ' s camera . mann ' s camera is a one man course in cinematography . it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film . it is almost never in the wrong place , never . < br / > < br / > the far country has one amazing moment . and as usual it comes from stewart . nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man . he is absolutely amazing : look at him in bend , far , winchester , and man from laramie : in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau , in far he is shot off a raft with such violence , it looks so convincing that you wince , and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man , well you find yourself looking for the burn marks . what an actor . not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room , also as well as anybody ever did it . < br / > < br / > but that was mann ' s territory : look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west . as painful as any fight scene ever recorded . cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart , nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight . in short , nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann . < br / > < br / > what a great , great director . < br / > < br / > see every western he ever made . they are his real monuments , even if all are scetchy . but so what . when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody , including ford . and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone , period . < br / > < br / > thanks , anthony . 
NEG first off , i really loved henry fool , which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers . parker posey is one of best actresses on - screen today . but this film was a full - out travesty . watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride , and making pointless analogies to star wars - was stomach - turning . this was hype on the producers part ( hdnet ) realized to the max . a true example of the emperor and his new clothes . mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever . i don ' t think i can ever see it again in it ' s pure , innocent light . < br / > < br / > remember hal , you can fool some of the people some of the time . . . etc . the director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage . sadly , it ' s a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation . the story must be exciting and active , or its box - office hopes are dim indeed . never mind a decent story . for the actors , it was like trying to act in a straitjacket . < br / > < br / > the score , i believe hartley ' s , is tasteless . with drum hits walking all over dialog . there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smile . < br / > < br / > when i saw the trailer , i thought , oh , they ' re just trying to grab a new audience . but it ' s really this ridiculous ride . i ' d be happy to spoil this movie for you , but it ' s been done . it ' s rotten . the fool franchise is dead . long live henry fool . 
NEG despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers ' movies , it wasn ' t until about 6 years ago that i first saw ' follow the fleet ' . i knew all the songs from an old astaire / rogers record ( yes , vinyl ) but knew nothing of the plot . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , while the songs are catchy and ginger rogers ' character is sweet and funny , you just can ' t like ' bake baker ' . while trying to make up to his longtime partner , he continually sabotages her career . his character doesn ' t have the usual humour and elan of the other films ' astaire characters . < br / > < br / > worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers . 
NEG i read the comment of chris_m_grant from united states . < br / > < br / > he wrote : " a fantastic documentary of 1924 . this early 20th century geography of today ' s iraq was powerful . " < br / > < br / > i would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran , the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass , a nation ' s battle for life . these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures . i am from this region of iran myself . i am a bakhtiari . < br / > < br / > chris , i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment . iran and irak are two different and distinct countries . taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican . thanks , < br / > < br / > ziba 
NEG randall " memphis " raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the " game " when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for british crime boss raymond calitri . the job involves " lifting " 50 cars in 24 hours or calitri will enact his punishment . so raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand . but the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes . it would seem a near impossible job to complete . < br / > < br / > it ' s got quite a cast has gone in 60 seconds , nicolas cage , angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , delroy lindo , vinnie jones , giovanni ribisi , christopher ecclestone , scott caan & timothy olyphant . all of whom deserve better . enough acting horsepower there to propel a porsche 998 turbo . trouble is , is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park , mucho characters , not enough zest . from the off we are in no doubt that this is a bruckheimer / simpson production , bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese , scattergun editing , and directed with sledgehammer subtly by dominic sena . it ' s essentially a big budget remake of h . b . halicki ' s 1974 indie movie of the same name , with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie . potential that sadly is never realised . there ' s one or two high impact moments , daft for sure , but enjoyable none the less . but if you pardon the pun , the film never gets out of first gear , it ' s more content to labour with its ream of characters who mope about trying to make the boorish screenplay { scott rosenberg } work . < br / > < br / > car fans will get something from it { the cars are ace on the eye } , as will fans of unintentional comedy movies { check out ecclestone ' s carpenter grief moment } . but no , it ' s really rather poor all told . 4 / 10 
NEG . . . to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century . < br / > < br / > " a river runs through it " certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand - point . great landscapes , redford acting well . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , the story is bad ( if there is a story at all ) . < br / > < br / > i felt sorry for the narrator / author , who is as dry , narrow - minded a character as his father , a preacher . being driven , not driving his own life , he is left to watch his brother , who is also caged in the small town environment , losing his life . the author never even comes close to undestand his brother ' s motivations , but at least realizes , that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun . all there is , is fly - fishing , where he follows even as an old man the style of his father . < br / > < br / > the end is not surprising , it is forseeable from the very beginning . < br / > < br / > definitely not a must - see ( 3 / 10 ) < br / > < br / > 
NEG having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 christmases , i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr . seuss ' classic tale , and well . . . it ' s not very good . first off , following a classic act like chuck jones ' animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone , but this interpretation is so heavy - handed and padded as to be positively numbing . i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags , but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab , at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas . jim carrey is typically over the top here , but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch . as characterised by boris karloff , he was a slow burn ; methodical and sly . there is no method to carrey ' s madness , and that is only the most obvious error made . talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here . why , universal , why ? i mean , i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered ( much like his countryman michael caine ) , but this one needs to be filed under " films that should never have been made . " this does not bode well for the cat in the hat , an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas . i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one : skip it , and either read the book or watch the tv special . this is 2 hours you can never , ever get back . 
NEG the story by norman maclean is a masterwork ; redford ' s film is a mediocrity . he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double - dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story . the cipher , brad pitt , trying to play the charismatic paul maclean , a genius outdoors , proves either risible or depressing , depending on what the original story meant to you . some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful . also , tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine , as men were once expected to be . none of the women make an impression in the film , which is regrettable , because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear , even poetic . 
NEG i have grown up with scooby doo all my life , my dad grew up with scooby doo . we have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself shaggy and scooby get a clue . what planet are warner bros on allowing this shambles to air . the characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister . the story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins ( who are scooby doo fans too ) . scooby and shaggy just aren ' t ! ! ! ! ! if anyone but casey kasem does the voice of shaggy it just isn ' t gonna work folks ! ! ! ! trust me . < br / > < br / > this program was disgraceful . what ' s new scooby doo is much better . why change a winning format . bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true scooby 
NEG i am 17 , and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes . i love the 1990s movies , and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade , scooby doo and the goblin king , which i wasn ' t expecting to be as good as it was . anyway , back to get a clue ! i watched some episodes , expecting something very good , but from what i saw of it , i wasn ' t impressed at all . first of all , i hated the animation . it was flat , deflated and very saturday - morning - cartoon - standard , easily the worst aspect of the series . even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation . even worse , shaggy and scooby looked like aliens , and i really missed fred , velma and daphne , as they added a lot to the old episodes , when scooby doo was positively good . i also hated the character changes , because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries , shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero , something they would ' ve never had done in the movies or in the scooby - doo where are you ? show . the theme tune wasn ' t very good either , i can ' t even remember it , and the jokes were lame and contrived . though , i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast , had they had better material , and hadn ' t been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible , which they did , might i add . in conclusion , i personally thought it was awful , and i am not trying to discredit it , it ' s what i personally feel . 1 / 10 bethany cox 
NEG this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous . i wanted to watch " darkness falls " actually and thought that this was the movie . boy , what a mistake ! i fast - forwarded as much as i could and still i couldn ' t get rid of the boring moments . i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie . they were actually given money for this crap . isn ' t that amazing ? i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood - grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee . please ! come on ! who gives money for such crap movies ? oh , and the " tooth - fairy " was lame . not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make - up . 
NEG the only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel . < br / > < br / > from start to finish " the tooth fairy " was just downright terrible . it seemed like a badly - acted children ' s movie which got confused , with a " wizard of oz " witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing . < br / > < br / > half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion . the sister of the two brothers , cherise the aura reader and mrs . mcdonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn ' t be bothered . the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on , at least try and have a slight plot for them . the story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch . < br / > < br / > add the weak plot and the weak acting together ( the children are particularly wooden ) and the movie ends up a complete failure . if only mst3k could have had a go at this one . . . 
NEG darcy and her young daughter pamela are heading out to the country where her mum ' s boyfriend peter left his doctor ' s position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn . although this inn has a terrible past and pamela learns from one the girl ' s who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house . they called her the ' tooth fairy ' as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth . this work on the inn , has awoken the ' tooth fairy ' . now she has her sights on pamela and her last baby tooth , but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits pamela . < br / > < br / > this flick ' s old folk myth of the ' tooth fairy ' doesn ' t paint her in a very generous way , as you would believe when you were a child . don ' t they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares ! another one which did fall into the same category was " darkness falls ( 2003 ) " . i can ' t compare how similar they are in the premises , because i haven ' t seen the latter , but i mostly read they have basically share the same idea . for a little straight to dvd film , this dtv effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device . low expectations are needed , as i wouldn ' t class it as an success , but i found it be to marginally entertaining . < br / > < br / > cory strode and cookie rae brown ' s story or background for this ' tooth fairy ' character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural . silly is a good way to describe what ' s happening in this poorly scripted story , but it never really feels like a fairytale horror . the dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded . while the acting is simply sub - par with the bland characters they have to work off , but director chuck bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts . this kinda makes up for the lack of suspense , the zero scares and generic tone . his direction is reasonably earnest and visually able , where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography . the promising opening scene is creepily effective . his pacing can slow up in parts and there ' s the odd and unnecessary slow - motion scene put in , but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that i wasn ' t bored . < br / > < br / > the make - up special effects provided the goods , as there ' s enough repulsive gruel and the tooth fairy ' s appearance is especially gooey . the figure of the tooth fairy can look threatening in its black robe , bubbling make - up and swift movements . being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness . child actors can be incredibly annoying , but nicole muñoz was decent in her part . lochlyn munro and chandra west are somewhat solid , but can be a little too causal in their performances as peter and darcey . the radiantly gorgeous carrie anne fleming is one of their lodgers . p . j soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn . < br / > < br / > i thought it was a okay time - waster that has a sound concept , which just isn ' t fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff . watchable nonsense , but at the same time extremely forgettable . 
NEG pathetic is the word . bad acting , pathetic script , cheezy dialog and hip hop music & fashion . . . what the hell was up with that ? the directer of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made . if someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing , it may of had a chance . bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so badly . < br / > < br / > the absolute best thing about this movie was stacey dash . . . the asian chick wasn ' t too bad neither . these too gals carried the whole movie . if it weren ' t for them i would have destroyed my copy of this movie . < br / > < br / > if any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to , don ' t waste your time . . . you ' ll only regret it later . 
NEG this was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that ' s where it ends . it seemed like a lackluster set it off meets the west . the plot barely made any sense . there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities . there were too may unnecessary things going on that didn ' t pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along . there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations . the script should have made more sense as well as the directing . i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie . but the casting was great in my opinion . if you ' re only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you . 
NEG don ' t let the name of this film deceive you , in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film . when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen , which he is often not , he ' s seriously relaxing . perhaps this adds to his charm , but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to " chill out " whenever he gets the chance . furthermore , unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents , this man has none , unless of course you call sleeping a talent . anyhow , this movie is basically worthless , the writing is sub par and the action , when there is some , is very lame . ( the machine guns on the jeep weren ' t bad , but that ' s about it ) so , if you ' re in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia , then this piece is perfect for you - it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep , but also his audience . 
NEG this film , originally released at christmas , 1940 , was long thought lost . a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd , now for sale . don ' t buy it ! the film is unspeakably terrible . the casting is poor , the script is awful , and the directing is dreadful . < br / > < br / > picture roland young singing and dancing . and that was the highlight . < br / > < br / > perhaps this movie was lost deliberately . 
NEG this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd . the print is not great , nor is the sound , but if you have $ 1 . 00 and 90 or so minutes to spare , you ' ll get your money ' s worth ( which is not saying an awful lot ) . anna neagle is extremely vapid as nanette . whatever her charms may have been back in the day , they are not evident in this film . a great number of fine character actors appear in this film ( helen broderick , zasu pitts , even arden ) , but the material falls remarkably short of their talents . still , it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing . the musical numbers ( there are really only two ) are quite horrible . clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original " no , no , nanette " . for what it ' s worth , the dvd can be had for $ 1 . 00 . it ' s worth that much just to say you ' ve seen it . 
NEG my roommate got the no , no , nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non - stop . after it finally totally brainwashed me into submission , i found the songs to be irresistible , especially the famous , i want to be happy , but i can ' t be happy . . . but of coarse from the soundtrack i had no idea what the film was about . so the other day i saw a copy of it at the video store and i rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film . i was thinking that it was going to be amazing , because the soundtrack is so cute . unfortunately most of the songs that i loved were nowhere to be found in the video i saw . now i ' ve never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldn ' t really understand what people were saying a lot of the time . really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940 ' s fashion . nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and kansas kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf . the one dance sequence is a little weird too with nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin - up girl imagery superimposed on top of her . actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin - up girls for money . i like how guillespe keeps it old school , and disses nanette when his masterpiece , the piece that was to make his career , is sold by nanette for a paltry $ 5250 . doesn ' t she realize that that piece was his immortality ? silly rabbit / girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat . when will you learn ? why doesn ' t he just pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the work away ? 
NEG i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content . my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything . < br / > < br / > when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught , it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly . it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked , preventing the servants from getting in . < br / > < br / > the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute . i have no clue what this was supposed to represent . 
NEG life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers . such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for ; but to be effective they must also be entertaining . unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read ; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round . the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwell ' s " 1984 " ( first published in 1948 ) , and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film . < br / > < br / > watch or read it : and then , when you are feeling a little depressed by man ' s inhumanity to man , reach for cinderella 2000 . this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing ; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period . most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments . to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption . there are many worse films appearing as dvd ' s these days , and frankly i do not care much what happens either way . < br / > < br / > so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been " the handmaiden ' s tale " , but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack london ' s towering novel " the iron heel " . ambitious as this would be , it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it ( imdb only lists a b / w silent version made in russia in 1919 ) . 
NEG this film is roughly what it sounds like : a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and ( fairly tame ) sex scenes ! the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess . it ' s more expensive looking than most of director al adamson ' s films but it ' s not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci - fi films . the actors are pretty bad and unlike most adamson films , there are no former big namers or b actors . some of the music is ok but it ' s easy to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years . 
NEG really , really bad . how does a film this bad get made ? i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point , interesting camera work , or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing . i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck ( except for the nudity and pancakes ) but it looks like genius compared to this dreck . the best script doctor in the world couldn ' t have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo . < br / > < br / > the only thing going for this " film " is that it ended . < br / > < br / > i ' ve got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something . ugh ! i ' m glad i only paid $ 5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill . 
NEG this movie was almost intolerable to sit through . i can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits , but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me . i ' ve seen better acting in a 4th grade play . aside from that the plot is unrealistic . if the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in . i was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that . that is not a copycat the zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn ' t him . another thing that really bothered me was that they called disassociative identity disorder dsm 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder . overall i think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore . plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at easy rider that had dennis hopper and jack nicholson and a low budget . 
NEG this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen . i ' m not exaggerating , i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves . the only thing interesting about this movie is the box . on the box it says " from the director of the boogeyman " so i figured . . . eh whatever , if this was made recently i ' m sure the directing at least won ' t be too bad : - \ , but after i saw the movie and looked at what " boogeyman " they were talking about , it ' s some nonsense from the early 1980 ' s that he made . great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers . < br / > < br / > anyway , i think that they just liked the name " zodiac killer " , and didn ' t bother to research any of the actual zodiac ' s crimes or his mo , or even the years that he was active . all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the " stories " about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiac ' s crimes did . they also compare the zodiac to " vampire of dusseldorf " fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritz ' s " son " quite often . the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike , and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people , not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks . none of the haarman facts are correct either , just a bunch of jumbled nonsense . his son even says " don ' t forget , his name was fritz haarman with 2 t ' s " . . . his actual name just has one ! i think that the writer / director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman . " ooh those sound like cool names , let ' s make a movie about them without doing any outside research ! great idea ! " < br / > < br / > perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsm - iv and getting cured of it . " i was also diagnosed with dsm - iv and have since recovered " , etc . for those of you who don ' t know , dsm - iv is the psychological manual for mental disorders . if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems ! haha . < br / > < br / > anyway , my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list , and it ' s rare that a movie ever reaches that point . but , if you are interested in watching a totally non - fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring , full of inexperienced actors , and not completely rational , i ' d say check out this movie . < br / > < br / > . . . oh , and i liked how the killer " tear gassed " a few of his victims with dry ice . nice touch . . . 
NEG i ' m a huge fan of ivan reitman - i loved evolution and who didn ' t like ghostbusters ? from the trailer you already know that uma ' s character will get dumped by luke ' s . so the build - up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him . but the pay - off is just not there . the shark tossing did manage to get a ( slight ) giggle but once again , it was all in the trailer . < br / > < br / > no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is diet owen on his good days . if not for riann wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp . this is a comedy , right ? < br / > < br / > it ' s not awful - it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge . this could have been such a brilliant send - up of superhero movies and feminism but fails on both counts . let ' s see if jason reitman can salvage the family name . 
NEG at what point exactly does a good movie go bad ? when does a movie go from " watchable " to " where ' s that & ^ @ _ + # ! * off switch " ? thank goodness for dvds , like this one , that can be borrowed from the library - for free ! likewise , thank goodness for the " fast forward " switch on the dvd player . i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office . < br / > < br / > at one point ( i ' ve forgotten exactly when because now it ' s all just a blur ) , our " hero , " luke wilson starts running through traffic ; i think he was looking for a cab . it was at that point when i gave up , realizing i couldn ' t care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck . < br / > < br / > the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster , hair dryer in hand , and first meets the " heroine , " uma thurman . that scene ended with the purse - snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far , far above the departing luke and uma . that was the last time the movie was funny , and when was that scene ? ten minutes into the flick ? < br / > < br / > every time the movie tried to become " funny , " it couldn ' t . every time the movie approached " excitement , " it fizzled out , heading in the opposite direction . when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard , the sound track stayed empty and silent . < br / > < br / > the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame ; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish . when uma turns into the crazy ex - girlfriend , i felt like i was watching " the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction " ; that ' s when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked " the 40 year old virgin " and " pulp fiction . " < br / > < br / > luke wilson ' s sidekick , rainn wilson ( also seen in the dreary " the last mimzy " ) adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie . rainn wilson , the king of television boredom , should stay with that equally awful medium . hey , rainn wilson ! leave full - length motion pictures alone ! every time uma ' s rival , anna faris , came on screen , i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery ; once you see anna faris in " scary movie , " that ' s all you ever see , no matter the movie , no matter the medium . the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick . 
NEG if they gave me the option of negative numbers i ' d use it . this movie was truly god - awful . i went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible , and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations . < br / > < br / > the script was weak , the acting was painful . i wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth , i think we were both disappointed . < br / > < br / > the growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong . eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain , he came off as oddly weak and silly . jenny johnsons ( uma thurman ) came off as psychotic and strange , as did matt ' s ( luke wilson ) friend vaughn ( rainn wilson . 
NEG i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise . very boring prequel to the main series . after the first 30 minutes , i was waiting for it to end . the characters do a lot of talking about religion , computers , programming , retribution , etc . . . there are gangsters , mafia types , who carry out hits . however , caprica doesn ' t have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts . < br / > < br / > let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies : as a general rule , if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation , then you know the movie will be a dud . caprica has lots of this . the director / writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies . it never works and all it does is demean the ( very ) young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them . directors / writers who do this should be banned from the business . < br / > < br / > if you want to be bored for an hour and a half , by all means , rent caprica . there ' s ( free ) porn on the ' net if you really want to see naked bodies . otherwise , move along , nothing to see here . 
NEG i considered myself to be quite melancholy , especially when i watch a great touching and tear - jerking movies . but not for this one ( which surprised me ! ) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly . < br / > < br / > there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies : 1 . despite guilt - ridden ben ' s real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past , i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action . some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly , in the end this was a disturbing action to me . < br / > < br / > 2 . the movie story line is over - dramatized , but the logic is over - simplified . medically , blood type match is required to be an organ donor . toward the end of the film we learnt that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period . nevertheless , it seemed that ben had the rare blood type , same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently , despite the rarity of ben ' s blood type , he was able to donate not only his heart , but also his kidney , his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen . < br / > < br / > 3 . why the doctors allow ben ' s organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself ? < br / > < br / > i might be over - analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie . however , some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie . if you go for a soap - opera type of film , go for it . but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment , give this one a miss ! 
NEG the 3 - d featured in " the man who wasn ' t there " stands for dumb , dumb , dumb ! this inept comedy features lousy 3 - d effects that makes the 3 - d effects in " jaws 3 " , " amityville 3 " , and " friday the 13th part 3 " look better by comparison . not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme . this was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop - off - the - screen effects . steve guttenberg and jeffrey tambor got trapped in this mess , but at least it didn ' t kill their careers . tambor would go on to star on hbo ' s " the larry sanders show " and ron howard ' s box office smash " how the grinch stole christmas " , while guttenberg followed this flop with " police academy " and " cocoon " . what them in those projects instead of them here in " the man who wasn ' t there " . if you do , you ' ll regret it . < br / > < br / > 1 / 2 * ( out of four ) 
NEG siskel & ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated . roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasn ' t really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated . now , when ben lyons comes on i feel like i ' m watching " teen news " - - you know , that kids ' news show , hosted by kids for kids ? manckiewitz is not much better . it ' s obvious they ' ve encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives . the idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous . if they are reviewing a non - formula film , they are completely lost . show them something original and intelligent - - they just find it " confusing " . wait - - i think i get it . . . abc is owned by disney . . . disney makes movies for kids . while siskel , ebert , and roper promoted independent films and were only hit - or - miss with the big budget studio productions - - what a surprise : these two guys love the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies . plus everyone knows the age group tv advertisers are aiming for . the blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake . in what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics ? 
NEG this one hearkens back to the days of the matinée , when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below . it didn ' t matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it . the adults , of course , would never see it . < br / > < br / > but they put it on video , anyway , along with most of the other creaky , low - budget " b " horror flicks of the golden age . . . of television . this film ' s inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology ( the " bad girls " harvested to replace poor jan ' s crushed body - they had it comin ' ) , overused plot ( a mad scientist , trying to play god ) , violent yet conscientious monster ( whose presence in the heretofore - normal - seeming scientist ' s rural lab is never fully explained ) , and acting that polarizes at wooden or over - the - top . < br / > < br / > this is a great party film , assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits . in fact , should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment , this film is also available on video in its " mystery science theater 3000 " treatment , in which the host and puppets of the cult tv series make the necessary additions for you . 
NEG hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres . in a bit of type - casting , jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human / hammerhead shark creature . bizarrely , this being is in fact his son , who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer . or something . < br / > < br / > a group of associates are invited to the scientist ' s private island . they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate . for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team . who knows why ? luckily , he turns out to be a resourceful , if somewhat overweight , ramboesque hero . i ' m working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support . a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someone ' s network connection followed by a call to gun down gun - toting evil - doers . or perhaps a call to fix someone ' s pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land - based human - shark hybrids ? anyway , he ' s amazing and saves the day . he even get ' s the girl . < br / > < br / > the shark - man is a slightly lame creation but ok , i guess , judging by the effects in general in this film . and the movie moves on at a decent pace . it ' s complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land - based killer fish , then really you have no one to blame but yourself . as it is , there are guns , gore , girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter . it ' s rubbish but not as bad as some might say . 
NEG dd films were damn corny , damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least < br / > < br / > this film isn ' t just a comedy but a mix of melodrama , romance everything < br / > < br / > every drama scene is blown out of proportion < br / > < br / > the comedy is funny but corny too yet the film keeps you entertained , those days govinda films were loud , crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed < br / > < br / > david dhawan does a okay job music is okay < br / > < br / > govinda acts well in comedy and drama karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts kader is as usual gulshan , prem chopra are typecast shakti is hilarious 
NEG i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it . the acting was bad . was the principal a robot ? he had no personality and his facial expression didn ' t change through the whole movie . at times the voices didn ' t match up . people talking and their lips didn ' t even move . 
NEG there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning . first of all we all know what this year ' s oscar ' s were really all about this year . it was the academy ' s way of showing people that they are no racist , and never have been . they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves . secondly , it ' s kinda pointless to make remarks about the show , because really , what difference will it make ? but , it ' s fun to write about it . this is the year i became fed - up with the oscar ' s ! i will never watch the show again . every year they do something wrong . before crowe wins for " gladaitor " when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for " sunshine " . if you haven ' t seen this movie yet , watch it and you ' ll agree . " eyes wide shut " when released receieved no nominations . and as far as this year goes , well , the bad choices were all over the place ! baz lurhmann gets no " best director " nomination ! are you joking ! ! " a beautiful mind " is up for " best make - up " ? ? ? ? " training day " gets nominated ? ? the movie was awful , and it seemed like washington didn ' t even turn in a performance , all he proved was , he knows how to use four letter words ! that ' s what h won the award for ! take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself ! i liked " gosford park " , i really did , but why 7 nominations ? and how on earth could they not give it too altman ! i mean , c ' mon , if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings , what about altman ? the man has been in the public ' s eye for 32 years now and no oscar ! there were many , many things that bothered me about this year ' s oscar ' s , but , i ' ll live with it , as long as i never have to watch another show again ! the highpoint ( and the only one ) of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show . that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show . 
NEG this film is a huge steaming pile . < br / > < br / > i have no idea why anyone felt that the garland / mason version needed to be redone , nor why striesand would have been a first choice to star . < br / > < br / > for that matter , i have no idea why our people ( gay americans ) tend largely to regard striesand as some kind of treasure . at least in my opinion , she had peaked professionally with with funny girl , and bogdanovich ' s what ' s up doc . < br / > < br / > do yourself a favor and rent the judy classic , or even the original ( a fine film in its own right ) , but please , please , please skip this stinkpot ! 
NEG rock star john norman howard ( kris kristofferson ) turns lounge singer esther hoffman ( barbra streisand ) into an overnight singing star . esther ' s star rises while john ' s goes into decline , thanks to drugs and alcohol . after about two hours , john does the self - destructive - red - converible - 160 - mph - crack - up - on - a - desert - highway thing . the best thing about this movie is the music , especially the song , " evergreen . " barbra streisand sings well , but you can ' t take her seriously as an up - and - coming star , when she is * already * a star . the very first time she appears , singing in a back alley bar , she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night , not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career . she is too confident , too professional . her apartment looks like a page out of " apartment living , " not some hole - in - the - wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live . < br / > < br / > kris kristofferson handles the self - centered , out - of - control rock star role like . . . well , like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn ' t have much acting talent . the direction is tepid , the story is slow and dull . < br / > < br / > but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting , or the lame direction , or the slow story . it ' s the hair ! after staring at kristofferson ' s and streisand ' s awful 70 ' s hairdos for 2 + hours , your eyes hurt . 
NEG andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40 - ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling - out with 2 long - time best girldfriends . < br / > < br / > seeing a gigolo / gold - digger in the sincere young man , the " girl - friends " , dead - set on terminating this " silly relationship " , go over and beyond the call of duty in " helping out " their friend ( who obviously is blinded by this gigolo ' s tricky game " . < br / > < br / > a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous . far fetched no longer covers it . without these unbelievable scenes , there may have been hope for a sweet love story . instead , all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head - - these things just don ' t happen ! without giving away cliff - hanger details , i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film ; most ( like me ) will be very disappointed . on a scale of 1 to 10 , this one ranks a weak 4 with me . there is much better material out there . this one isn ' t worth your time . 
NEG " the 700 club " has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself . to make matters worse , it ' s been on the air since 1966 , implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies . headed by pat robertson , the unscrupulous , megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition , " the 700 club " takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding , broadcasting " news " as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world ' s problems are to blame on homosexuals , wiccans , new age spiritualists , muslims , jews , hindus , non - fundamentalist christians , democrats , single mothers , foreigners , feminists , evolutionists , environmentalists , nasa scientists , and anyone else who doesn ' t share their fanatical religious views . it ' s actually the best fake news since " the daily show " or the " weekend update " segment of " saturday night live , " or since " fox news , " for that matter . of course , pat ' s always the one who makes each of the decisions , saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts . in the meantime , he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another - no less than a measly $ 100 to become a member , by the way - to fund pat ' s african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment . no , never mind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth ; it ' s all for the greater glory of god , don ' t you know ? and of course , the hosts of " the 700 club " are always willing to read letters " written by viewers " as they like to put it , coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by " viewers " supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts ( they claim to have " words of knowledge " come to them ) but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them . honestly , how can anyone take a show seriously when they ' re using a poor applause recording ? it should make people wonder why there ' s no studio audience . < br / > < br / > the sad thing that pat ' s cronies and viewers don ' t realize or just don ' t want to realize are the horrible things he ' s done and said . this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism . ironic , considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department ; i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements . his rants against homosexuals , single mothers , and any number of sexual practices he considers " sinful " are interesting , considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war . as the bible says , be fruitful and multiply , so congratulations , pat - thanks to you , there ' s probably a number of children born to single korean mothers . then , of course , there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez ( not that he ' s a saint , but still ) . oh , yes , and let ' s not soon forget the time this " crusader for human life " supported forced abortions in china . very " christian " of him , wouldn ' t you say ? < br / > < br / > and just in case pat has forgotten , i haven ' t forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are " being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany . " honestly , to compare his " plight " to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable . speaking of which , need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals ? of course , history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews . pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history . if he was pinocchio , his nose would encircle the earth . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , more and more people continue to believe him every day . this is your wake - up call , people ; " the 700 club " is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history . it ' s evil masquerading as good ; it ' s a wolf - in - sheep ' s - clothing . it ' s bigoted filth that tries to look clean , pretty , and loving . it ' s living proof that hateful , dangerous religious views aren ' t confined to certain groups in the middle east . even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught , and if jesus was to appear to this " club , " he wouldn ' t be emulating them . instead , he ' d be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time . all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president ; if he did , he ' d be the harbinger of armageddon - and not on the side of the good guys . 
NEG i can ' t believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 . i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons , but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that ? i was a huge fan the 1st season . i was hooked - all the mystery , suspense , unexplained events . you never knew what was going to happen next . by season 2 , i was still watching faithfully , but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained . and instead of giving you more answers , it just seemed like more questions . i love suspense , but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching . < br / > < br / > now , i can ' t even remember what finally turned me off , but somewhere in season 2 , i had enough . i ' m not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can ' t miss an episode to stay up on what ' s happening . so , it was no longer worth the effort to me . < br / > < br / > it ' s a shame that they couldn ' t have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans . i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out . don ' t they realize that in the end , they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain . 
NEG i saw this recently and i must say , i was moved by the factual basis of the story . however , " holly " as a movie did not quite work . i am however , looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because i think that would be a much more compelling work than this film . < br / > < br / > the international cast was composed of b - class actors but their acting was appropriate , and i must give a special mention for the young actress who played holly . this was her first movie role and she did a very nice job , considering hers is the most challenging part . < br / > < br / > ron livingston was adequate but bland as patrick , the american whose quest is to " save " holly , but chris penn was good in this , his final role . unfortunately , despite my mostly favourable opinion of virginie ledoyen and udo kier , both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film . < br / > < br / > i believe in the film ' s message and intention , but i have to be fair , so i rate " holly " 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie . but i think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and i am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which i hope will have its debut on bbc and other tv networks . 
NEG the story is about the life of common people from antwerp , living their lives . so i said it , and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story . the movie is fast , like an mtv - flick , and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films . so let ' s forget about this one and hope for the best with the next deus - barman picture . 
NEG this show was laughably bad . the writing sucked , the dialog sucked . the guy who played craig couldn ' t act his way out of a paper sack . being it was on thursday night , this was definitely great to watch with some beers . cool music , bad acting , poor writing , all came together for my entertainment . < br / > < br / > it was a drama / unintentional comedy . i don ' t care what happened to any of the characters , they were all boring and stupid . the first five episodes were the worst , since they couldn ' t reveal who the victim was , they had to write the dialog around it , which was terrible . i mean , the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous . actually , all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible . < br / > < br / > so , let ' s review . everything happening in present time sucked . the flashback scenes , only the writing , dialog and craig ' s acting sucked . the music ruled though . 
NEG this movie was just terrible , the first movie wasn ' t that great i mean it ' s ridiculously stupid if they didn ' t have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one , why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond , i ' ll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink , i don ' t understand , was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn ' t be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror , a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film . please no more of these movies . 
NEG i couldn ' t believe how lame & pointless this was . basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie , hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie . this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion . i think keanu reeves must ' ve taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in the matrix . uma thurman looked very simple & humble . luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons . i won ' t write anything about the story of the movie , but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across america because of her huge thumb . i would give this movie a 2 / 10 . before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4 . 0 / 10 , & now i know why . a very disappointing movie . don ' t buy it even if you see it for under $ 5 . 
NEG i read tom robbins ' even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager . i loved every word . it was sexy , funny , and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing . but when i saw the movie , i could not believe what a dull , sour , joyless piece of junk it was . how did this happen ? i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under " gay pride - - women - - lesbians . " ( that ' s the library of congress subject heading . ) now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians , any more than star wars is about real space travel . the book was obviously - - and i do mean obviously - - written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians ( in the nude , all the time ) but has never really met one . < br / > < br / > still , someone in hollywood said , " uh oh , better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble . " so they handed it to gus van sant . nothing against the man , but - - however gay he may really be - - he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film . gus van sant took a straight man ' s playful fantasy of guilt - free girl / girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull , literal - minded lesbian power recruiting poster . it ' s like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy . not pretty . < br / > < br / > the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting . his clout allowed him to hire the very best . his ignorance of the novel ' s real subtext ( a straight man ' s fantasy , not a gay pride recruiting poster ) caused him to make choices that were not only bad , but bizarre . < br / > < br / > let ' s meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues . < br / > < br / > pat morita as " the chink " okay , there are few name - recognition asian actors . and pat morita , in happy days , was fairly funny . but casting him as the chink was wrong , wrong , wrong . pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man . ( gus didn ' t tell him . ) pat also doesn ' t seem to know that the chink is . . . well , sexy ! ! ! in the book he ' s not wise old mr . miyagi . he ' s more like hugh hefner ! he ' s a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean . ( you see , in the book , they aren ' t really lesbians . do you get that this is a straight man ' s fantasy yet ? ) < br / > < br / > john hurt as " the countess . " okay , he ' s a gay friendly man . but he is a serious , shakespearean actor ! ! ! ! you need someone who is fun , and camp , for this role . for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad . i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more , and sadly shake his head . " now , richard , you know you ' ve lost your soul entirely . for shame , my former student ! " and yes , john hurt was funny ( and pretty gay ) as caligula . but that was black humor , not playful and breezy humor like the book . < br / > < br / > rain phoenix as " bonanza jellybean . " no talent , no training , no problem . except that in the book bonanza is funny , playful , cheerful , ( mostly ) heterosexual , and loving . in the movie she ' s sullen , passive , expressionless , and dull . as for her taste for women , robbins in the book puts it like this . " god knows i love women , but nothing can take the place of a man that fits . " uh , gus ? did you read this book ? < br / > < br / > uma thurman as " sissy hankshaw . " this is a tough role . in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine . still , a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye , or a sway in her walk , to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures . uma doesn ' t pull it off , probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs . uma plays it more like she ' s in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia . < br / > < br / > this movie is sour and dull . and i accuse you , gus van sant ! 
NEG this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re - animates the dead . he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by . his brother then infects the other gang members . in some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense . the acting is mediocre but the story doesn ' t help the film . the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies . the budget for this film i ' m sure was very limited . i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget . if you wan ' t to see a good zombie flick don ' t see this one . 
NEG it was a painful experience , the whole story is actually there so i won ' t go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work , i thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn ' t even tell him anything about it . . . not to mentioned bad acting very bad can ' t get any worst than that my advice don ' t watch and i thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently uwi boll ' s movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this ! 
NEG hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored ( lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing ) . i find that 95 % of amateur movies and 90 % of home video footage is better than this film ( although the similarities between them warrant the comparison ) . " hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies ! " . hopefully nobody else wasn ' t . my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie . 
NEG i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one . edward furlong , you ' re not as good as you think mate , you can ' t grab on every piece of low - cost amateur crap , which sole intention has to be to get some bucks . < br / > < br / > the filming is bad , and i mean bad . anyone with a camera would get the same result , or better . < br / > < br / > the acting , lets just say : don ' t go to the supermarket looking for actors . the good ones usually come with a degree or , at least , have some damn experience ! the director . . mr . jon keeyes , please find your purpose in life , as a director you simply suck . your directing is poor , the angles are all messed up ( not in a good way ) , the lines seem as if they ' re being read out of toilet paper , and the damn music . . it always comes up when it shouldn ' t and goes out for no apparent reason . and don ' t go for writer either , by the way . making movies isn ' t like serving on a coffeshop , it requires art and skill , things i really doubt you ' ll ever have . < br / > < br / > instead of making a badass shootout movie , you should ' ve shot this one back to oblivion and wait ' till something good came up . . or just go find a job on a coffeshop . you ' ll have less stress and you ' ll save movie goers some money and a bad night . < br / > < br / > vote : 1 / 10 ( my first one ) 
NEG if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director , louis malle , i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes , as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary midwestern american town in 1979 . this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies . considering i didn ' t know any of these people , it was even less interesting . < br / > < br / > because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary , i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey ? perhaps it was that values aren ' t as conservative as you might think - - this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes ( such as the republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine ) . or , perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town - - as several ugly ideas such as blaming jews for financial conspiracies , anti - black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored . < br / > < br / > the small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed , but when the film makers returned six years later , the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan . this seemed very disingenuous for several reasons . first , the 1979 portion was almost 90 % of the film and the final 10 % only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne . what about the rest of the folks of this town ? did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative ? with only a few updates , it seemed suspicious . second , while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years , so did the gross national product . and , while malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period , it was far from that , as the period from 1974 - 1980 featured many shortages ( gas , sugar , etc . ) , strikes , high inflation and general malaise . while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration , the country , in general , was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years . while many in the media demonized reagan ( a popular sport in the 80s ) , the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one - sided and agenda driven . had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadn ' t seemed too negative to be believed ( after all , everyone didn ' t have their lives get worse - - this defies common sense ) , then i might have thought otherwise . < br / > < br / > overall , not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be - - ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985 . < br / > < br / > by the way , is it just me , or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired , at least in part , by this film ? both are set in similar communities , but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones . 
NEG the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy , shaky , camera - work and the fast , confusing cutting . i am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like oliver stone and steven soderbergh proof with most of their movies , but in this case there was way too much . it seems like the jump - cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable . the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end . for a movie that pretends to be violent , ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it ' s story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development . that is another disappointing aspect of the movie . if i want to watch an over the top action flick i do not need any justification , but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of denzel washington ' s character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances . the first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens . so the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama / thriller , nor as a pure action movie . of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years , but i absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool . for a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance . 
NEG well , i do like the gore in this movie - it is genuingly unsetteling . anyone that ' s been to the dentist will know why . the story really isn ' t that bad , corbin bersen ' s character ' s motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies . < br / > < br / > i ' ve seen worse acting , directing , script , etc . but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie . so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not . i tried to watch the sequel , but it was exactly , exactly the same thing as this movie . just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist , then this is the movie for you ! 
NEG i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn ' t forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _angel_ , you ' ll enjoy the film . me ? all i wanted was a nice , tight little story , and it wasn ' t there . the pacing was practically backward , plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue , and there was absolutely no sense of dread , or tension , or anything . < br / > < br / > is it the redneck ? is it the wendigo ? no , it ' s a cameraman on speed . that ' s not scary . it doesn ' t generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you ' re scared by mtv . like those reviewers before me , i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience . < br / > < br / > terrible film . 
NEG anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies . this movie was an insult to watch , the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography . the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion ! the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie . someone mentioned that this film was about a child ' s imagination , okay thats all good and fine . but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did . i mean come on , the indian in the store . did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo ? which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here , so you think okay creepy ghost scenario , but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy . that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic . the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg ! ! ! why the hell did i just waste my time watching this ! ! this is a move that i recommend not to watch , there are definitely better quality films out there that won ' t insult your intelligence ! thank god i never had to pay to see this movie , i would have demanded my money back ! for those that were easily entertained by this movie . . . . it ' s very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie . 
NEG if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one . . . incredible bad . . . the main characters ( the mom , the dad and son ) are ok . specially the mother she ' s a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary . but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point , triller and good script . the script hasn ' t any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing . if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it , otherwise just stay at home and sleep . oh . . . actually there was something funny : the movie ' s from 2001 but we couldn ' t realize it since the image is so bad ( like on mini - dv ) and the cars are so old ( like 70 and 80 ' s ) . 
NEG what an incomprehensible mess of a movie . something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom ( and from the size of the jar he ' s been shot about fifty times by now ) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico . whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear . and you ' ll never hear another screenplay feature the word " butthorn " either . gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from " lethal weapon " and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity . william smith does another turn as a russian soldier , the same character he played in " red dawn " a few years earlier . after playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist heavies . sadly he ' ll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood whupped in " every which way you can . " 
NEG yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply ( and badly ) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980 ' s and early 1990 ' s are there still lurking out there ? for the record ( not that you will care really ) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard , under siege and speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability . < br / > < br / > the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses , the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son . < br / > < br / > the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand ! the acting is as wooden as the deck , the script woeful , the one liners predictable , the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through . < br / > < br / > there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere ( although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time ! ) is there any chance of something at least half decently made , semi believable and most important original ? ! ? no , i thought not . . 
NEG think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as " power rangers " and you have this film from 1990 , " robot jox " . a movie where you fight with giant robots , two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins . the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good , it isn ' t all bad to watch . there are as i recall two robot fights in this one , one that ends badly and the final showdown . there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed , but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done . the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage , but still somewhat fun to watch . this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament . so it is worth checking out once , but probably not more than that . 
NEG title : robot jox ( 1990 ) < br / > < br / > director : stuart gordon < br / > < br / > cast : gary graham , anne marie johnson , paul koslo < br / > < br / > review : stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re - animator , from beyond , dagon and castle freak , took a small detour here and did a little sci - fi flick . i stress the word " little " since this is a very low budget flick , and there in lies its main weakness . < br / > < br / > the story takes place in the future . a world in which the great superpowers ( that according to this movie are the united states and russia ) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war . . . but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots . our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander . lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues . < br / > < br / > well , the idea is awesome i guess . the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots ? interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available . unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director . < br / > < br / > i as a kid loved this movie , and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie , you ' ll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it . i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like " what the hell is this piece of crap franco ? " and i ' m like well this movie is a sci - fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon ? " but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture . i could go through it , cause i loved this film as a kid , and there ' s still a little nostalgia attached to watching it . but everyone else was just not going to get it . < br / > < br / > and i myself realized that the movie isn ' t really that good . first off . the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other . and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you ' d have to use some damn good special effects to make it work , expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief . but unfortunately this being a small scale movie , from a small scale company ( empire pictures , which went bankrupt after making this film ! ) the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them . heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed . < br / > < br / > ok granted , once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other . there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool , and made me go " thats why i liked thid movie ! " but every know and them , some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in . and boom , your right back into realizing this film just doesn ' t live up to its premise . < br / > < br / > and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie . this movie is basically a movie for kids . you know , giant robots duking it out ? stop motion animation ? hello ? but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody . so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not ? after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities , which really isn ' t a good mix . < br / > < br / > so for those of you who don ' t feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don ' t have a nostalgic connection to this movie ( like i do ) well id suggest you steer clear away from this one . gordons a great director , but this movie he made , just didn ' t do it for me . well , at least not now that i ' m a full grown adult . < br / > < br / > rating : 2 out of 5 
NEG bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex . so he buys a van to aid in this quest . the acting is lame , the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills . the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time , but fell a long way short . they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin , because this will supposedly add comedic value . < br / > < br / > i ' m struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film . if you like devito , this is another classic devito kind of role - but he ' s only a supporting actor and there for cliché value . 
NEG i haven ' t seen it in over twenty years . oj was the bus driver , arte johnson was the tour guide , lorenzo was the kidnapper . < br / > < br / > yea , lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain , a natural . i think i watched it back then most for oj , who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing , but also to see arte johnson . < br / > < br / > i was a little bored that johnson was so serious . < br / > < br / > and yes , it shifted plots . in reading other posts , i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl , but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue . < br / > < br / > i was going , a stamp ? if it came on as a late movie , i would probably record it to check it out again , but i wouldn ' t be nostalgic over it . not yet anyway . < br / > < br / > there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out . 
NEG caught part of george 2 on tv recently , but couldn ' t get myself to watch it through to the end . just awful ! i can ' t even remember the plot . all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie , which was bad enough . there ' s a lot of scrambling around , but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy , it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes . having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this . george 2 is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen , and that is saying something . jeez , because of imdb ' s 10 lines rule , i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made - for - tv sequel . disney , hang your head in shame . 
NEG dear me . . . peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been . but his choice of films , say , after 1964 , was very unfortunate . he didn ' t seem to realize how to use his talents . he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did . of his later films , only " the optimists of nine elms " and " being there " have impressed me of those i have seen . < br / > < br / > that said , the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - i have yet to see " carlton browne " and " heavens above ! " - at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree . but , " there ' s a girl in my soup " really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers ' part in terms of character . in his films from 1955 - 64 , you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles . here , you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead . it ' s almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality . he certainly does not convince , try as he might , or create an interesting character . he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant , and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for . < br / > < br / > hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry ; this is no easy , genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy . it is very artificial seeming , all the way through - i know that it is part of danvers ' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies , but he doesn ' t really change from that in a way that convinces . sellers has a very grating way of playing " charm " as well . . . this character really has no depth , and really does not gain the viewer ' s sympathy or interest . sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty , iconoclastic performance in " lolita " . < br / > < br / > there really is nothing to say about the plot , direction or characters , as frankly they leave little or no impression . this is truly one of the most anaemic , complacent , misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen . a nonentity of a " vehicle " for sellers ' undisputed talents . < br / > < br / > rating : - * 1 / 2 / * * * * * 
NEG this was the worst film i have seen for a long time . < br / > < br / > not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies , the story is obvious , flat and absolutely not funny . < br / > < br / > the girls are nice though , but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film . < br / > < br / > this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad , made for an audience that is not older than 12 . < br / > < br / > i never visited an american college , but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes . < br / > < br / > save your time , do something else . 
NEG for those with little time on their hands , i ' ll sum it up quickly , in one word . . . pathetic . there are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description . so much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you . want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes ? you got it ! the reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap . you can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for ! ! ? ? ! ! ! < br / > < br / > i ' ve watched many a movie franchise decline over the years , but american pie ; beta house has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie , it ' s still a thousand times funnier than this dreck . < br / > < br / > the plot is predictable , and sometimes you actually feel like you ' re watching a school play . the things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it ( we ' re talking star wars levels of suspension , like the kind you need to convince yourself jar jar is real ) < br / > < br / > the plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke . there is no acting talent to speak of , all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh . and ohhh how they fail ! ! ! ! every gag falls flat and the only thing i laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be . how else can you explain the bulls * * t they try to pass off as a story ? < br / > < br / > they pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written , lowest common denominator nonsense . the characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of beta house , but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening . its a very lazy way of telling a story . it also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so . ( imagine say the wizard of oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it , and all we see is dorothy high - fiving the scarecrow every now and again and saying " gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then " ) lazy . lazy . lazy ! ! ! ! < br / > < br / > the female characters have little or nothing to say . all they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie . you braindeads that only seek t & a will not be disappointed , but for that reason alone shame on you . if you buy this on dvd you will be contributing to the downfall of society in your own special way . congratulations . 
NEG jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before . the bad guy plays a " malkovichian " character from " in the line of fire " . the cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf . . . 
NEG lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money ! ! < br / > < br / > this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk . the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with . if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen , flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket . . you may get more enjoyment that way . the acting was terrible , the plot was completely unrealistic , ( along with the so called " twist " in the end . i must say this . . the ending did surprise me . i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me , but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie . they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn ' t even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room . < br / > < br / > casting was awful for a few reasons . first of all , they must have accidentally switched the character assignments , because michael douglas played the roll that clearly keifer sutherland should have been playing . while douglas was sneaking around agents , tapping phone lines , hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him , sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren ' t going that badly for him . he plays a very bland agent , nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love . < br / > < br / > i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas . it can be best compared to a remake of the " the fugitive " / " in the line of fire " but written by people with mental disabilities 
NEG although the casting for this film was admirable , particularly dianne keaton and tom everett scott , the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching . < br / > < br / > my wife and i decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck , and it was almost impossible to turn away . it may have been that we " hoped " that the message would eventually make itself apparent , and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort . unfortunately , this did not happen . < br / > < br / > of course the audience may have been able to " make sense " of this convoluted tale , a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd . the writers , however , did nothing to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning . < br / > < br / > it was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts , and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non - existent . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , made - for - tv movies have seemed to devolve over the years . whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past , present - day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience , concentrating primarily on manipulating us to " stay - tuned " through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as surrender , dorothy are made . 
NEG ( very light spoilers , maybe . ) < br / > < br / > normally a fan of diane keaton , i tried to watch this tonight . i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother . both came across as self - absorbed with little regard for others , with the daughter also adding in rude , disrespectful and reckless to the mix . when the daughter died , the only thing i thought was , " at least we won ' t have to watch her anymore . " keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving , but it was too far gone for me by then . i simply wasn ' t enjoying it , so i stopped watching . if you want me to care for the protagonist , you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner - - if it ' s nearly an hour in and i don ' t care , it ' s too late . < br / > < br / > the supporting cast was sincere and well played - - i felt for * them ! * - - and the gay best friend was wonderful , but even combined , that wasn ' t enough to carry the film for me . 
NEG distasteful , cliched thriller has young couple doing cross - country research on america ' s most infamous murder sites , becoming road partners with a dim - witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend - - who is an actual psycho . arty and alienating , the film ' s tone alternates between pouty pseudo - irony and silly flamboyance . handsomely - made perhaps , but ultimately laughable . brad pitt ' s performance as the low - rent killer is godawful . * from * * * * 
NEG there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters . a bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue . i ' ve just seen this on tv and i didn ' t think it was a ' film ' as such , more a post - ' this life ' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it . stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately , irrelevant middle class " lifestyle " crap that takes itself far too seriously . it ' s got david baddiel in it and that bird out of " cold feet " , you know what to expect . there was a lot of this stuff about in 2000 , it was a particularly british malaise . . . " they ' re educated and doing drugs ? friends , but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships ? sounds great ! " . this kind of nonsense , and post - guy ritchie comedy - gangster stuff . . . dark days . if you have taste , this will annoy you to the point of violence . 
NEG ( spoilers ahead ) russian fantasy " actioner " ( and i use the term loosely ) that i ' ve been trying to watch for over a year . i ' ve finally gotten to the end and now i wish i didn ' t put in the repeated effort . < br / > < br / > in an effort to save two hours of your life i ' m going to tell you he plot - a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom . things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend . he takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home . the guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well . < br / > < br / > very little is said . no explanation is really given for anything ( like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum ) and the action , for the most part is all off screen . the film essentially consists of a guy who looks like adrian brody looking intense and not saying anything , killing people ( off screen - most of the action happens off screen ) . it looks good , is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film . hell , i would have liked some sense of real character development or back story ( all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid ) . the movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six . if they weren ' t going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast . no instead we get the hero on a boat . the hero in a bus , the hero walking , the hero looking disturbed . hero with his girl . it really annoyed me since i think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give instructions to " get this guy " . < br / > < br / > 4 out of 10 . its about four hours ( all my attempts to see this ) i ' ll never get back . only for those who want to see a brooding russian action film with very little action 
NEG the 60s ( 1999 ) d : mark piznarski . josh hamilton , julia stiles , jerry o ' connell , jeremy sisto , jordana brewster , leonard roberts , bill smitrovich , annie corley , charles s . dutton . nbc mini - series ( later released to video / dvd as full length feature film ) about the treacherous 1960s , as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family . the film ' s first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families . however , dutton ' s character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull , incoherent , and downright awful 2nd half . rating : 4 out of 10 . not rated ( later rated pg - 13 for video / dvd release ) . 
NEG hilarious , laugh out loud moments . . . and yet not a comedy . i particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the " filthy bum " who then shouts after them in anger " you filthy bums " , i mean wow , someone ' s online degree in literature is paying off ! the worst script imaginable , with plot introductions in an instant , ridiculous movement in the story , zero character development ( even between the characters who meet . . it ' s as if they all have known and trusted each other for years ) dodgy voice over with added echo effects , and plot holes . . oh god are there plot holes ! ! to be honest i write this not even having watched the entire thing , but i certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema . . . thank god we ' ve got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of . . . well . . . use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence ! 
NEG the movie was to be shown here in bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater , it failed miserably . < br / > < br / > apparently the story writer just don ' t hold water . something was definitely missing . in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past . accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment . < br / > < br / > the movie just lack any substance . the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story . and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time , such as the meaning of sacrifice , nationalism , etc . it is called the central theme . < br / > < br / > the movie fails to answer , why would i watch it anyway ? < br / > < br / > at least some strange legendary flying elephants , psychic king , or the eccentric king such as " the king and i " would have been lovely , something would have added greatly to the movies ' appeal . i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie . < br / > < br / > once you got the appeal , then the story is the next thing we concentrate on . in marketing terms , we call it " must see " . upon hearing the title of the movie people would say , oh , i must see it . now where ' s the appeal in kingmaker ? why not just redo the title and call it , " how not to be a king ? " and make a black comedy of the old siamese days , to the style of " dr . strangelove " . that would have been much more interesting . narrative - like experiences of the foibles of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny . < br / > < br / > most movies today have that " must see " appeal , such as spiderman , men x , these titles speak for themselves . if they don ' t have familiar characters , some other movies such as , the island , had an appeal itself when the advertising asks " do you still believe there is an island ? " . < br / > < br / > or for the movie , retitled " how not to be a king " might ask the question , " so do you still want to be a king ? " < br / > < br / > parhat 
NEG savage island ( 2003 ) is a lame movie . it ' s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting . not only that the storyline and script was wretched . i don ' t know why this movie was made . i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry . this one made my blood boil . the situations were inane at best . if i made a movie like this it would have been a short . really because those backwood " idjits " wouldn ' t have been in the picture . < br / > < br / > don ' t be fooled by the cover on the d . v . d . i am an avid watcher of bad cinema . but this movie is virtually unwatchable . i don ' t mind movies being shot on d . v . but if you ' re going to do that make the movie enjoyable , not some tired retread of superior horror films ( sans wrong turn ) . < br / > < br / > i have to not recommend this waste of disk . if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by . < br / > < br / > movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1 . 
NEG as with most of the reviewers , i saw this on starz ! ondemand . after watching the preview with my girlfriend , she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched . i , on the other hand , thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching . i mean , the design of dr . meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title . after watching it , i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it ( namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story ) , it ' s best to pass over this one . < br / > < br / > * major spoilers ahead * after making their first video for their as - yet - unfinished cd , the lead singer , cassidy , kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her . 3 months later , the band is trying to decide if they ' re going to finish the album or not . to try and see what cassidy would have wanted , they go to see an old psychic friend of hers , dr . meso , and try to contact her through him . in his card reading , dr . meso turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members . bad times are ahead . ( i just wanted to make a point that later in the film , they do explain that the death card really just represents change . kudos to them on that at least . ) even without the approval of their deceased friend , they decide to go ahead and finish the album . but while in the bathroom , cassidy ' s best - friend , dora , catches a glimpse of her deceased friend . when another band - mate goes in to check on her , dora is standing in the dark , requesting his sunglasses . that ' s when the killing begins . < br / > < br / > my main problem with the film from the very get - go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault . too many warping effects , unnecessary zooms , and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film . an incoherent storyline doesn ' t help anything either . while the narrative hangs together for the first part , once cassidy is resurrected , everything falls apart . we have jump - cuts between cassidy and dr . meso ( who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building ) , which show they are connected in some way or another . however , within a few minutes of that revelation , we find that cassidy really is an independent being from meso . she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker . but not in a good way . < br / > < br / > from this point on , the whereabouts of cassidy are shown , but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence . one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk , when a character enters in the next , she ' s nowhere to be found . as he moves behind the desk , we see her at the end of a hallway . then in another room grabbing the keys ( which neil already has ) , then back again . not to mention that from one moment to the next , cassidy ' s mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it . one moment , she wants to kill everyone ( although she ' s only wounded 90 % of the characters ) - the next she ' s apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again . sound confusing ? that ' s because it is . it ' s a jumbled mess that i ' m sure the writer couldn ' t even figure out . < br / > < br / > as for the performances , most are particularly wooden . some though are interesting , but overall this isn ' t a piece that would be known for it ' s acting . the story is the driving force behind this piece . 
NEG i ' ve probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment . i just didn ' t get any chemistry between the 2 main stars . a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn ' t do it for me , and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester . had the casting director actually ever read the book . very strange ! he ' s a fine actor but mr . rochester he definitely isn ' t ! and zelah was just , well , strange , bit of a mix matched couple . in it ' s favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation , but overall didn ' t capture any of the magic of the novel . certainly wouldn ' t ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel . a real let down ! 
NEG michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems , nonetheless , to be regarded as a perfect " catch " by any woman that runs across him ; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co - produced the film ? he ' s a " hero " whom it ' s very difficult to empathize with , so the movie is in trouble right from the start . however , it ' s troubles don ' t end there . it has the production values of a tv - movie ( check out that head made of clay or something , near the end ) , and the ending cheats in a way that i can ' t reveal , in case anyone wants to see the movie ( highly unlikely ) . let ' s just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows . ( * 1 / 2 ) 
NEG a cast of 1980 ' s tv movie and tv series guest stars ( misty rowe , pamela hemsley , clevon little , seymour cassel among several others ) in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models . of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications . < br / > < br / > over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest . this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax . i really can ' t see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there . ( i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking , to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up ) 
NEG genie ( zoe trilling ) arrives in egypt to visit her hypocritical , bible - quoting archeologist father ( william finley ) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the marquis de sade ( robert englund ) . englund also plays de sade in flashbacks , ranting in his cell . genie is led astray by mohammed ( juliano merr ) , who rides around naked on a horse and sabina ( alona kamhi ) , a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking , which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers , a woman simulating oral sex on a snake , an orgy and her father preaching in the background ! meanwhile , black hooded cult members decapitate , gouge out eyeballs and slit throats . when genie is slipped drugs in her tea , she imagines de sade hanging from a cross , a gold - painted woman in a leafy g - string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes . it ' s all because she ' s the reincarnation of de sade ' s lost love . < br / > < br / > this typically sleazy harry alan towers production is redundant , seedy and pretty senseless , but the sets , costumes , cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there ' s always something going on . < br / > < br / > score : 3 out of 10 
NEG i ' ve seen plenty of sci - fi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 ( my first one was sabretooth - which actually is one of the more entertaining sci - fi channel features in my opinion ) . their quality varies . some of them are average but decent ( sabretooth , dragon fighter , never cry werewolf , swamp devil ) , some are laughably bad , and then there are some that are truly terrible . raptor planet lies in the latter . < br / > < br / > raptor planet , a loose sequel to the 2004 sci - fi channel original raptor island , is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting . the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life ( a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet ) are some of the worst looking effects i ' ve seen in a low budget film . the gore effects are even unconvincing . < br / > < br / > the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason ( i forget why ) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs . that ' s right folks , the dinosaurs are aliens . dinosaurs in outer space . what ' s next , sharks in space ? ! ? the rest of the plot is simple . the human cast are picked off and eaten . by now , we ' ve come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released , but this is the first killer dinosaur movie i ' ve seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks . < br / > < br / > there are a few chuckles in it though . there ' s one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur ( brought to life by stock footage from the original film ) that seconds later becomes a giant raptor . also , a bit of trivia , this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie . < br / > < br / > while raptor island wasn ' t a good film to begin with , its a masterpiece compared to its sequel . < br / > < br / > believe me when i say , this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired . it ' s darn near unwatchable . 
NEG wowwwwww , about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie ! ! ! i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i ' d give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better . or at least have some redeeming qualities , like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie , or like really intelligent , or very well filmed or something . . . needless to say , that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life . im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this " may contain spoilers " . . . imdb , you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that . i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings . . . all the ratings with about 7 - 10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie . . . im still a big imdb fan , but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3 . 
NEG killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you either love it or hate it . i personally like it , but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone . the tomatoes aren ' t the same , jokes are lame , even the actors aren ' t as funny . because that ' s the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be - funny . < br / > < br / > so now following the plot made to laugh , is annoying . they really shouldn ' t have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy . 
NEG the title above is used to introduce the film " gen " to its audience . gen is about a young doctor ( doga rutkay ) with an ill mother . the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job . while she drives , we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area . as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital , she sees the death body of a patient . this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days . < br / > < br / > two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide . in fact , they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions . all their communication with outside world is cut off too . there is no way out ! ! in those few days , there will be more nasty murders . now everybody suspects from each other . < br / > < br / > in my opinion , the idea is brilliant . it could have been very scary indeed . there are positive sides of the movie of course . i really like the beginning of the movie . especially , when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital . actings are okay . some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though . i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie . what i am saying is , it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end , we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening . the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn ' t work well . also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital . lastly , i would like to say a few things about the director . i am sure he will improve . this is his first attempt . i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old . that made me feel more positive about him and his future films . i am not going to rate this film * out of * * * * * though . 
NEG take young , pretty people , put them in an exotic locale , stick in a few bad guys , have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes , create the flimsiest of plots , then work out a happy ending for everybody ( other than the three or four who get murdered , of course ) that ' s the classic ( and successful ) format of the harlequin romance . it ' s not very good but then it ' s not very bad either , like most of the little yellow pocket books . and the location stuff in budapest is especially interesting , even if they didn ' t use the wonderful old train station ( designed by gustave eifel ) or show the city ' s famous thermal baths . 
NEG the sitcom " the league of gentlemen " follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village " royston vasey " . the different scenes are linked together by their common setting . < br / > < br / > in the first series , a sketch show , the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey . consequently , more foreigners visit the small town . but edward and tubbs , the owners of a " local " shop , which is actually far away from the town , do not like foreigners . whenever a visitor enters their shop , they kill him . in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all , for example , when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road . edward drums , while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims . < br / > < br / > moreover pauline lives in royston vasey . she works at the local job centre . although pauline hates the people she has to work with , the woman does not want to loose her job . so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman , she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet . < br / > < br / > then there is barbara dixton , a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about " her " sexual conversion . < br / > < br / > furthermore the vet , mr . chinnery , always kills animals instead of curing them . in one case , he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room , where a dog lays in his basket . the farmer goes outside . on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal , mr . chinnery euthanizes him . a second later , the farmer opens the door , holding the " real " sick animal , a sheep , in his hand . < br / > < br / > some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew ( his friend is killed by the shop owners , by the way ) . the couple is very tidy . they have , for example , towels in different colours . each colour stands for one part of the body . besides , they have thousands of keys , marked with different colours and precisely classified . < br / > < br / > in my opinion , the actors play very well . by playing women , the scenes become comical . the costumes are suited to the actors , too . tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters , for example edward , have unappetizing black teeth . the show has a great deal of dark humour , typical british . the set design reflects the mood of the series . the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed . around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect . even the village sign is ominous : " welcome to royston vasey . you will never leave . " < br / > < br / > although i think that the actors do a great job , this type of series is not my taste . 
NEG i saw this movie when i was really little . it is , by far , one of the strangest movies i have ever seen . now , normally , i like weird movies , but this was just a bit too much . < br / > < br / > there ' s not much of a plot to the movie . if anything , it starts out like toy story , where toys come to life , and raggedy ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend , babette . from there , craziness ensues . there ' s the greedy , the looneys , a sea monster named gazooks , and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes , all of which just made the movie weirder . also , i can ' t help but feel that babette is annoying and a bit too whiny . she definitely didn ' t help the movie . < br / > < br / > now , even though i didn ' t like this movie , there were a few cute parts . i liked the camel ' s song . even though it was a song about being lonely , it had a friendly feel to it . then , there was sir leonard . while most of the looneys were just plain nuts , sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest . king koo koo was just a little dirtbag that made dr . evil look like a serious villain . also , there was raggedy andy ' s song , no girl ' s toy . it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough . but , honestly , even these things didn ' t make the movie any better . ( but remember , this is just my perspective . ) < br / > < br / > while i personally wouldn ' t recommend this movie , even i have to admit , it does have its charming moments . see it if you ' re interested , but only if you ' re in the mood for something " really " out of the ordinary . 
NEG batman mystery of the batwoman , is , in a word , stale . < br / > < br / > the plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante ( " batwoman " ) is intruding on batman ' s turf , and while batman is trying to combat a penguin / bane / rupert thorne threesome , he ' s trying to figure out who the mysterious batwoman is . < br / > < br / > there is nothing strikingly wrong about this , but there is nothing really special about it either , noting really made it stick out . < br / > < br / > mask of the phantasm had bruce ' s long lost love re surface and mess with his head . < br / > < br / > subzero was a major event in the life of mr freeze . < br / > < br / > even the batman beyond movie spin off , return of the joker , dug deep with the characters involved . < br / > < br / > but mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplots , a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat . frankly , this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight , lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in it ' s prime . 
NEG i admit that the majority of this film was uninspired , but i was still entertained . it has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy , above average music , and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves , there ' s no prissies here . i can think of dozens of other films that were way worse , at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary . they allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics , destroy everything in sight , even if it means the people you ' re supposed to be saving . also , how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist . fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work ( zombie , beyond , gates of hell ) in an effort to somehow improve on them . he failed , but definitely not miserably , like a number of people would have you think . i have a soft spot for zombie films , so i admit that i ' m somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them . all i ' m saying is that this movie is good for one time around , if there wasn ' t so much descension in the making of this film ( fulci quit and bruno ( i can hack with the best of them ) mattei took over ) it could have been much better and more focused . it ' s going to stay in my collection as fulci ' s zombie swan song . one surprising note , is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off , i couldn ' t believe it myself , check it out you ' ll be surprised . 
NEG when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3 ( zombie flesheaters 2 in europe ) on an import region 2 japanese dvd , i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is . the transfer is just about immaculate , as good as it ' s ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it . the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx . the sound is also terrific . it ' s only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2 , you can really appreciate the cheesy music ( actually a very good score ) , and the effective although cheap sound effects . it never sounded so good , and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment . < br / > < br / > i never realized just how much blood flows in this film , it ' s extremely brutal with exploding head shots , exploding puss filled mega pimples , a cleaver to a zombies throat , a woman ' s burned off extremities ( how come it did ' nt burn the guy also ) , intestinal munching , zombie babies and so much more i lost track . < br / > < br / > this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans , especially of the italian kind . there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found , i think people don ' t give it enough credit , if you see a clean print , and not some horrendous pirate copy , it ' s a whole other experience entirely . < br / > < br / > this film never lets up for a second , and i realize it ' s inconsistent plotwise , the dubbing is horrible , the acting is stiff , and it ' s sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion , but that ' s part of it ' s charm . < br / > < br / > to me this is one of the best horror films ever made , you can ' t make a film this bad , so good , on purpose . it ' s accidental genius of the highest order . if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster , but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it ' s nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards . < br / > < br / > tons of action sequences , exotic locales , excellent set design , good , sometimes great cinematography , wonderfully cheesy acting , and inconsistent but still interesting plot , great makeup effects , beautiful women who can kick butt , excellent music , and sometimes hilarious , sometimes creepy , but always entertaining zombies . how can you go wrong with this film , it has it all , a cult classic that stands the test of time . 
NEG this was filmed back - to - back with the 1992 re - make of conan doyle ' s famous novel ' the lost world ' . and it shows . < br / > < br / > the film starts promisingly enough , with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau , but then things go downhill . everybody is stranded on the plateau and we ' re left with a feeble , boring , over - length rehash of the first film . < br / > < br / > the dinosaurs ( who are hardly ever seen ) are just laughable . are we expected to take that cuddly toy that ' s supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously ? and the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot . < br / > < br / > do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the lost world . unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects , the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re - make . 
NEG holy sh * t this was god awful . i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor oedipus rex . dear god . this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff . please save your money , this movie can offer you nothing . unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters . you know , h3ll , bring your girlfriend and make things interesting . you will be the only ones there anyway . f @ ck this slide show . < br / > < br / > ye be warned . < br / > < br / > i recommend not watching this . < br / > < br / > hello . < br / > < br / > how are you ? < br / > < br / > i ' m pretty good . < br / > < br / > enjoying this day ? < br / > < br / > i am . < br / > < br / > this comment was one - hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie . this is sad . 
NEG i am a very big fan of jenna jameson , but this movie is horrible . at the time jenna jameson was married to brad armstrong and he was the director of this film and jenna was the hottest porn star ever . so , of course , brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film . now i know why they don ' t make big budget porn movies anymore . in a fantasy world , porn stars could act , but this is the real world and they can ' t act . that ' s why there porn stars , if a women as beautiful as jenna could act , then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn . just because your beautiful doesn ' t make you a movie star . a fine example of this is traci lords , when she was a teen thru her 20 ' s she was one of the most beautiful , sexy women on earth . she made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn ' t act . where is she now ? i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because jenna is so hot , but there are better movies she has made then " dream quest " . come on jenna , we don ' t want to hear you talk , as much as we want to see you have sex . also , you jenna , would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film . 
NEG i ' m glad that i saw this film after mr . sandler became famous . < br / > < br / > it is bad . . . . bad , bad , bad . there is no plot . it ' s like watching a painfully dull home movie . < br / > < br / > i really enjoy his other films . . . . . . but if you ' re a fan like me . . . . stay away from this one . it may change your thoughts on adam . you may never recover from the horror that is this film . . . . i ' ve had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home . . . . . . . 
NEG pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning . as an example , bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds . why ? they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive . < br / > < br / > this film has absolutely no substance . the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero . why ? he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking . no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone . even worse , when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red - neck terrorist , no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends . < br / > < br / > jason priestley co - stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero . < br / > < br / > the ending is absolutely unbelievable . 
NEG . . . okay , maybe not all of it . lured by the false promise of bikini - clad women on the movie ' s cover . . . but the horror . . . the horror . . . . . . whatever you do , do not watch this movie . gouge out your eyes , repeatedly bash your skull in . . . do what it takes . never again - - never forget ! < br / > < br / > 
NEG this movie is so bad , it ' s comical . in fact , mystery science theatre 3000 , the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies , used this very film to mock . i suggest watching it ( maybe on youtube ) instead of actually seeing this movie . < br / > < br / > please , do not see hobgoblins if you ' re not prepared to stop within the first scene . actually , do not see this movie , period . please . at least not seriously . its jokes are not funny ( to say the least ) , and you ' ll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie . < br / > < br / > you may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching , so spare yourself . read a book . do the laundry . anything is more fun than watching hobgoblins . 
NEG if movies like ghoulies rip off gremlins , then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghoulies . these barely - animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies ( which involve basically groteque characters ' sex dreams - oh joy ) , but what that has to do with anything is anybody ' s guess , except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica . they show this down in the 8th circle of hell , one suspects . there ' s no real plot - just " goblins - kill ! " and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience . 
NEG hobgoblins . . . . hobgoblins . . . . where do i begin ? ! ? < br / > < br / > this film gives manos - the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made . this one is fun to laugh at , where as manos was just painful to watch . hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term : " 80 ' s cheeze " . the acting ( and i am using this term loosely ) is atrocious , the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see , and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed . the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k , and that version is the only way to watch this mess . this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one - liners they have ever done . if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the bots . . . . . god help you ! ! 
NEG let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this . normally i enjoy robin williams movies , however this gem was not one of them . it was billed as a suspenseful thriller . the night listener was anything but . to be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day , 2 walked out , for good reason . the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed . the acting was alright but again there wasn ' t anything to work with . the movie is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid . however * insert spooky here * no one can verify the kids existence . so williams goes to wisconsin to try and find the author , however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker . there thats it , thats all . you wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends . it had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit . the homosexual undertones , or overtones had really nothing to do with the story , and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense . in conclusion i really can ' t write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it , it was as captivating as watching paint dry . i gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasn ' t directed by uwe boll . 
NEG " house of evil " aka " dance of death " of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibánez . unlike " snake people " ( 1971 ) , " the incredible invasion " ( also 1971 ) and " the fear chamber " ( 1972 ) which were all released after karloff ' s death in 1969 , " house of evil " was released in 1968 , when karloff was still alive . " house of evil " is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies , which are without doubt all rather crappy , but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are . i personally prefer " the fear chamber " and " house of evil " over the other two , simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme , and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies , the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor . < br / > < br / > the odd story ( i don ' t know if i can really call it a ' plot ' ) is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century . after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out , mathias morteval ( karloff ) , an enthusiastic organ player , invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion , which is full of eerie toys . his kinfolk includes lucy durant ( julissa ) , who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders . < br / > < br / > i won ' t give away more of the story , but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie . there are some very funny moments , especially some things karloff ' s character says . boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived , and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness , and although ( or because ) his role is ( due to a poor script and and directing ) in no way scary , it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor . just like in the movie ' s successors " snake people " and " the fear chamber " , the female lead is once again played by julissa . < br / > < br / > most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish , the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt . the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense . it is the poor story and dialogue , however , that makes this movie so entertaining to watch . " house of evil " may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie , but it is certainly as ( unintentionally ) funny as it is bad . fans of ed wood ' s movies should be very amused , i personally found it hilarious . crappy but entertaining nevertheless , and definitely worth watching since there ' s boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor . 3 / 10 
NEG the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher ( casper van dien ) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant , now there ' s something you don ' t see everyday . matt is working for property developer morton ( robert wagner ) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist angela ( kristen miller ) for reasons i ' m unsure of . anyway they both try to figure out what they ' ve got on they ' re hands when some of the team go missing , morton calls in security guy ammon ( navid negahban ) to handle the situation . meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt ( tom bosley ) translates some ancient text ( as he would ) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the fallen one , or something like that . it ' s up to matt to save the day & the whole planet . . . < br / > < br / > written & directed by kevin vanhook , who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start , i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film & it ' s as simple & straight forward as that . there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical & conceptual level , the script doesn ' t make a whole lot of sense & it doesn ' t really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live . the character ' s are awful & as clichéd as you like , the dialogue is bad as in very , very bad & the entire film is predictable , i mean it ' s not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it ? it ' s not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state . this is bad , very bad . you have been warned . < br / > < br / > director vanhook doesn ' t impress , the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple ? they look naff . to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there ' s not that many of them since he doesn ' t make an appearance for over an hour , there are also some normal sized mummy ' s that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy ( 1999 ) , unfortunately these aren ' t used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief . the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it , actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is . forget about any scares , tension or atmosphere & don ' t even think about any gore or violence because there isn ' t any . < br / > < br / > technically the fallen ones isn ' t anything special & apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there ' s little her to get excited about . the ghost cgi & water effects are terrible , it was made - for - tv & it ' s shows . the acting was poor , wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of dien & bosley can get these days . < br / > < br / > the fallen ones is a bad film , there ' s no two ways about it as far as i ' m concerned . not recommended on any level or in any way , one to avoid . 
NEG this is supposed to be well - researched and based on fact . how come therefore that it ' s so packed with mcgovernisms . did the people of derry live in some kind of bizarre philip k . dick world in which reality was uncannily like cracker / liam / priest ? or is mcgovern an idle hack who just keeps repeating hims 
NEG i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies , and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror , but when it comes to comedies , they really need to be crazy to be funny . ' over her dead body ' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously , and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about . the story is completely unbelievable of course , and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register . the choice of the principal actresses was awful . while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy , the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged ( sorry ) for him , and lake bell seems too unattractive ( sorry again ) . a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start . jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles . the rest is uninteresting and uninspired , with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies . nothing really worth watching , nothing to remember . 
NEG this movie is similar to the play entitled ' blithe spirit ' written by noel coward . the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to coward ' s writing . i ' m surprised that movies of this nature don ' t acknowledge the original writer ' s concept . i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is . < br / > < br / > sad . these movies are so expensive to produce . i do perk up when a screenplay is original . i even perk up when it ' s an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released . there were some samples mentioned ( such as topper , etc . ) . < br / > < br / > i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment . however , i ' m not please when the public ' s taste is taken for granted . in this situation , the public ' s taste is overlooked . < br / > < br / > i look forward to better produced movie entertainment . < br / > < br / > in this case . i rather see the play . 
NEG jeff lowell has written & directed ' over her dead body ' poorly . the idea is first of all , is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake . < br / > < br / > minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film . eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance . < br / > < br / > paul rudd looks jaded and least interested . lake bell is a complete miscast . she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance . jason biggs is wasted , so is lindsay sloane . < br / > < br / > i expected entertainment more from this film . sadly , i didn ' t get entertained . 
NEG this movie was not made by who fans . most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half - hour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over : in christmas , they didn ' t show daltry ' s screams after the line " tommy doesn ' t know what day it is . . . " , they showed almost * no * townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard , there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror , and worst of all , in the second half of we ' re not gonna take it ( listening to you ) , they robbed us of almost every shot of pete ' s blazing guitar chords . huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band . it ' s a very frustrating film to watch , and doesn ' t deliver the goods . i don ' t know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan , or worse , for him at least , if he * is * a who fan and this is all the * eight * cameras could deliver for him . to its credit , there are some rare numbers before tommy , as well as some faves , that are very well shot , and sometimes the editing is brilliant . this might be enough to make some viewers happy , as long as you ' re not anticipating tommy . the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv ; it may be different on video or dvd . 
NEG there ' s really no way to beat around the bush in saying this , lady death : the motion picture just plain sucks . aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence , the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980 ' s cartoon based on a line of action figures . the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe , has the obligatory inept henchman , and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon . just don ' t expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue . at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai , yet there is no sex , no tentacle rape ( thank goodness ! ) and very little sex appeal , this despite the physical appearance of the title character . there is simply no adult edge to this material , unless you count the half - naked heroine and bloody deaths . essentially , what we have here is a feature length episode of she - ra , princess of power , but with skimpier clothes and more gore . 
NEG the movie has one nude scene : a man sitting on the edge of the bed , with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen . it is quite a long scene . what was the point ? i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn ' t funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute . < br / > < br / > the movie is cold . none of the characters are even likeable . audrey tatou is cute , of course , but her character is an unhappy girl . < br / > < br / > i really would not recommend this movie . i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing . i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust , educated french family and he looks down on these characters . < br / > < br / > 
NEG children love dinosaurs . it ' s somewhat part of their culture . but they ' ve got the land before time . the original . at least that movie had heart . this . this movie is just plain pathetic . just because kids love dinosaurs doesn ' t mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children . this movie has no plot , the whole premise is stupid , and it ' s more by the numbers stuff . not as soul sucking as theodore rex , but it ' s lightyears away from being a land before time . 
NEG once again , like charlie ' s angels , inspector gadget and thunderbirds , a tv series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched . basically the duke cousins , luke ( johnny knoxville ) and bo ( seann william scott ) in hazzard county , spend a lot of time driving very fast in " the general lee " . but they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty jefferson davis ' boss ' hogg ( razzie nominated burt reynolds ) to make way for a huge coal mine . they get help along the way from their sexy cousin daisy ( razzie nominated jessica simpson ) and uncle jesse ( willie nelson ) , while being chased by equally mean sheriff rosco p . coltrane ( lost ' s m . c . gainey ) and the police . also starring joe don baker as governor jim applewhite , jack polick as deputy cletus hogg , david koechner as cooter davenport , michael weston as deputy enos strate and lynda carter as pauline . i think the only reason i give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts , and of course the gorgeous body of simpson ( i ' ll admit her legs aren ' t quite catherine bach , but still ! ) , but besides that it is pretty boring . it was nominated the razzies for worst picture , worst director for jay chandrasekhar , worst remake or sequel , worst screen couple for simpson & her " daisy dukes " and worst screenplay . pretty poor ! 
NEG i ' ll tell you what happened , some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on tv . did we really need a big screen re - make ? did they ask the fans ? i wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of " rocky horror picture show " with actors like ashton krutcher , steve martin , britney spears , and kiefer southerland , took out all the music , and made it a drama . do you think they would like that ! this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had . sure the original was a bit corny at times , but bo and luke were always nice , they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble , and their main objective was to help people that passed through town . none of that mattered to the people that made this film , they might have never even seen the original show all the way through . my big question is , what will they ruin next ? 
NEG bah . another tired , desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed . < br / > < br / > on the plus side , toni collette is superb as always ( being an actual actress , you see ) , and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes . there are even a few genuinely funny lines , and the filmwork , score and editing is competent , apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion . < br / > < br / > but , ah , but . much of the cast seems to be on autopilot , and they are almost all very clearly too old ( and in one case too young ) for their declared ages . worse , they are all speaking " austinese " , that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn ' t be further from the way people actually spoke in austen ' s day ( think yosemite sam , i kid you not ) . this is particularly sad , considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial " fakespearan " that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs . < br / > < br / > and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow . she ' s only ever played one character in her films , and she stays true to form here , running through her entire range ( smirking to sulking ) in the first ten minutes , then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film . there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers , nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart . < br / > < br / > in short , there is very little reason to watch emma . it ' s an amiable enough adaptation , but if you ' re going to pack a film full of anacronisms ( i . e . an appalingly thin lead who can ' t shoot a bow or handle a period accent ) then you might as well do it properly , as with the vastly superior " clueless " . 
NEG this scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager . now i find it more amusing than scary , but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that i like . and , come to think of it , the plot is rather disgusting actually . . . but handled with some kind of taste . if there is a problem with this movie , it is that there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens . also , the ending goes on forever , making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with barbara bach screaming and screaming . the " monster " , after it is exposed , isn ' t very scary either unfortunately . the somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it , making it appear as a tv - movie more than something made for theaters . but it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so i urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic . . . 
NEG interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event , even though he did save many other captive children . the film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways , bathrooms and even class rooms . in other words , the high school is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal . dolph lundgren , ( sam decker ) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field . however , the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher . it is at this point in the film when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomb . try to enjoy it , if you decided to view it ! 
NEG michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top - billed character in the golden child , and because he loves kids . that didn ' t work ( and why should it ? ) , so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing " kid midas " . i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor ' s inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that ' s a step closer to ishtar . whatever murphy says or does can be best liked , but don ' t get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent ; he doesn ' t belong in this movie , and the same went for dr . dolittle ! the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic , and that wouldn ' t have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy . speaking of visuals , they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan ' s presidential fame . murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs , but this stale movie isn ' t my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste . 
NEG well , what ' s to say . the golden child falls in the category " so bad , it ' s good " . eddie murphy is having some funny ( and sometimes quite annoying lines ) , but you are still entertained . chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa ( what a f * * * ed up name is this ? ? ) . < br / > < br / > who should watch the golden child . . . hm . . . difficult to say , but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting , bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog . < br / > < br / > 4 out of 10 
NEG for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film , this film is ok as movie musicals , nothing special , just ok . i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production , the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don ' t even know where to begin . first of all , for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production , let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play , the director , producer , and choreographer never ask personal questions and don ' t give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer . a real theatrical audition , whether it be for a play or a musical , rarely takes more than five minutes . if you ' re auditioning as a dancer , you get shown a 64 - bar dance combination once , you do it , and then they decide immediately whether you ' re in or out . michael bennett ' s original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little . the play is about these dancers . first of all , director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie / zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach . in the play , you never see zach . . . he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon . cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry ( a character who is not even in the play ) was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about . major musical numbers were cut or rethought . the opening number in the play " i hope i get it " shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated . in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can ' t dance ( can you say " audrey landers " ) . " goodbye 12 , goodbye 13 , hello love " , a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers ' childhood ' s jaundiced memories was reworked as " surprise , surprise " mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie . the show ' s most famous song , " what i did for love " which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance , becomes just another standard love song in the film , performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie . jeffrey hornaday ' s choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn ' t hold a candle to michael bennett ' original staging and when you ' re making a movie about dancers , the choreography has to be special . there are a couple of good dancers in the film , the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie , michelle johnston as bebe , and janet jones as judy , but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do , yet audrey landers , who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time , is given one of the show ' s best numbers , " dance 10 , looks 3 . " i will admit that the finale , " one " is dazzling , but you have to wait almost two hours for that . i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage , this film might be worth a look , but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical . . . be afraid . . . be very afraid . 
NEG i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award , but after watching it , it ' s easy to see why it didn ' t . despite the beautiful photography , the film is incredibly slow moving , despite having hardly any plot . < br / > < br / > the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents ' death in what may or may not have been an accident ( the film is never clear on this ) , and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories . the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot , but they ' re very short , and don ' t really seem to have any point . < br / > < br / > the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life , but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient , but that doesn ' t make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure . perfect metaphor for this film really . < br / > < br / > the photography of skye is beautiful though , but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed - and it ' s infinitely better than this one . 
NEG this is a typical 70 ' s soft core sex romp in the russ meyer genre , though perhaps less outlandish than some of meyer ' s work . this film has higher ' production values ' than many of it ' s contemporaries , suggesting a larger budget . it ' s plot , writing and acting are straight out the b zone , though . of late , this film has become a mainstay of b movie channels ( such as " drive in classics " ) in the 500 channel universe . if soft core is what you are in the mood for , this is as " good " as anything else in the b range . don ' t expect polanski though , sarno is just sarno . nothing more , nothing less . jennifer welles performance as the " mother " is perhaps the best of the cast . none of the actors in the film went on to greater fame , unsurprisingly . confessions of a young american housewife is far from the worst example of it ' s kind . it is watchable , if this is your type of film . 30 years ago , this would have been an avant garde and riske film . you can see more or less the same kind of thing on showtime / hbo series these days , and in prime time . 
NEG this is easily one of the worst 5 movies i ' ve ever seen . it ' s not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline . this movie is agonizingly slow and i was bored for almost all 98 minutes . while the acting is mediocre at best , the biggest problem is the script , which is poorly written , slow and plodding with no real direction . occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event . i ' m not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots , they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script . as a huge fan of good horror movies , i ' m always irritated that something this bad gets made . save yourself 98 minutes you ' ll never get back . 
NEG mercifully , there ' s no video of this wannabe western that a stay - afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering . the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back - room writer . all in all , this show stinks . the story is basically boring , ill - conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence . i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it " . . . underrated . . . " the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so . you ' ll have to catch it on the last show , if you up late and having a bout of insomnia . but , if you can sit through it , you ' ve more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends . 
NEG frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns . he was a great actor , from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that , but he did not have the physique of a western hero , you identified him as an urban guy . but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho , the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault . i blame it on two factors : a ) the story was too unusual , specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie . in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern , to break away from it the film has to be very good . b ) the story is not convincing , it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother . also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible , why all the gunfighters have not adopted it ? i think that this film should not have been withdrawn , because any film with sinatra is worth seeing , and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable 
NEG james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish . affleck is just a lightweight who just can ' t cut it , the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable . i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre , i soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes . i walked out before the end it was so bad , so imagine my surprise when back in england i saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo " paul ross " in one of the down market sundays . i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets , if he says the movie is good , i get straight on this very website to check it out . this movie should have gone straight to £ 1 . 99 dvd in a supermarket near you . 
NEG this movie is terrible . terrible . one of the worst movies ever . i cannot even imagine gigli being worse that this . previews made us say " no " , but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now , we decided to go ahead and give it a shot . < br / > < br / > stupid us . < br / > < br / > affleck is not an actor . he ' s an image and can look good with explosions , but not even the kind bruce willis got in " die hard " . if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys , it would be a comedy . < br / > < br / > the best part was catherine o ' hara - - she ' s always good . gandolfini flops again ( if it weren ' t for the sopranos , he ' d be washed up ) like he did in " the mexican " . < br / > < br / > affleck hogs every scene and as others have said - - no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions . < br / > < br / > avoid this movie at all costs . 
NEG surviving christmas ( 2004 ) ben affleck , james gandolfini , christina applegate , catherine o ' hara , josh zuckerman , bill macy , jennifer morrison , udo kier , d : mike mitchell . dumped by his girlfriend , a hotshot yuppie doesn ' t want to be left alone on christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home , imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family . an obnoxious and one - dimensional performance by affleck , who mainly acts with a flashy smile , makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep , but gandolfini and o ' hara breathe some life into this mess . even for farce , its silliness is lumbering , not much makes sense from scene to scene , and its sentimental messages are as phony as affleck ' s grin . 91 min . , rated pg - 13 . * ½ 
NEG i get the feeling that those involved in making " surviving christmas " didn ' t put much thought into the movie . the characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the one - liner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend christmas with them . < br / > < br / > ben affleck portrays drew latham , the typical hollywood image of a wealthy , egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life . his girlfriend , missy , leaves him shortly before christmas because she ' s disgusted that drew wanted to take her to fiji for christmas , which she calls " the family holiday , " and the fact that drew has never introduced her to his family . we later find out that drew ' s father left when he was 4 years old , and his mother is dead , so it ' s a mystery why he doesn ' t just say that he has no family , rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn ' t care about his family . < br / > < br / > out of fear of being alone on christmas , drew tracks down missy ' s shrink ( why ? i have no idea ) , who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home . when he meets the family living in his childhood home , the valcos , drew offers them $ 250 , 000 to pretend to be his family , so he can relive his fond childhood memories . he gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter , alicia ( christina applegate ) , because he " doesn ' t have a sister , " and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his " real " family . none of this makes any sense once drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother . < br / > < br / > also inexplicable is the character of alicia , who is annoyed that her family accepted drew ' s money , and refuses to play along with his fantasy . but for no good reason , she suddenly starts to like drew , and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend . drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy ; i almost wish he had finished with , " just kidding ! the real reason i don ' t see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me ! " ( 2 / 10 ) 
NEG i rarely write reviews for imdb . com , but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible . just terrible . i like shaw bros . movies ( i ' m not a hater . ) , and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many " 10 best kung fu / martial arts movies " websites . ( i ' m now convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut - and - paste jobs . ) first of all , there ' s barely any action in the film . most of the movie consists of talking about the plot , which is an amazing feat because it ' s thin at best . and the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 , but it ' s routine by today ' s standards . a special warning to netflix users : the dvd they ship is terrible ; the picture is horrendous and it ' s not even 16 : 9 enhanced . 
NEG i have given this show ( i have only watched seven episodes ) four stars because most of her jokes / set - ups appear to fail . some are not funny outright , but some are amusing - - in a 12 year old boy kind of way . she reminds me of that new york painter who throws paint upon a canvas , calls it art and sells it for a lot of money . silverman throws out what she ' s got , including the kitchen sink , while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different . < br / > < br / > however what she ' s " got " often times is not enough , as though she lacks the kind of follow - through a good comedian needs to succeed . < br / > < br / > the whole enterprise is like an under done potato . 
NEG somewhere inside this movie is a half - hour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out . whereas cube was taut , well - made , claustrophobic and mind - engaging , i ' m afraid cypher is a bloated , tedious rehash of several well - worn themes which just don ' t add up to much , especially if you have seen almost any other half - way decent sci - fi film before . < br / > < br / > cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending . none of the characters spark off each other , and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy . it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube . it ' s not a bad movie , but it is most definitely not a good one . < br / > < br / > when you ' ve watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film , but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating . 
NEG i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasn ' t impressed . i know it ' s taboo to knock independent films , but this one felt devoid of entertainment . < br / > < br / > the premise was interesting , but the execution of it fell short . i found myself thinking " okay , they ' re just getting into it , the story will pick up soon " . before i knew it , the film was over and the story never picked up . i can ' t say i found the acting all that impressive either . it was pretty bad . not star wars prequel trilogy bad , but bad nonetheless . < br / > < br / > i ' m not sure what the running time was , i ' ll assume two hours ( because it ' s a safe estimate ) . anyway , when the film was finished , i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through . < br / > < br / > again , i was thoroughly unimpressed , and eventually bored out of my wits . i ' m not one of those guys who requires fast - paced action and explosions in a film , so don ' t start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it . 
NEG i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again . < br / > < br / > i have seen action films , i have even liked quite a few of them , but this one goes over the top . < br / > < br / > not only does it have the worst male actor ever ( sly stallone ) playing the lead role , but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning ( why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground , would be hell of a lot easier ) that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it . < br / > < br / > furthermore , the plot has no real twists at all , a three year old kid could guess what comes next . it is a set of cliches ( of action genre ) , with sly performing even worse than his other movies ( he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film ) . now there is an actor who can ' t act a ) surprised b ) sad c ) anything else than his basic face . < br / > < br / > i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it . explosions are outstanding , but then . . . you can see better on the 4th of july . landscapes are magnificient , but then . . . there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas , so you can see better sights that way , rather than waste time on this flick . < br / > < br / > go watch some other movie instead , there are hundreds , even thousands better action movies . 
NEG i don ' t think i ' ve ever felt this let down by a film before . after loving guy ritchie ' s two previous films ( i don ' t count swept away - he was pussy blind ) , i was so looking forward to seeing this . < br / > < br / > the reviews were poor , then again , i don ' t trust the press anyway . more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker , so it was with some trepidation i handed over my £ 4 . 80 yesterday afternoon . < br / > < br / > i ' m not even going to try to explain this film , mainly because i haven ' t got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn ' t get it ! < br / > < br / > unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife ' s trap of taking himself far too seriously . it seems it wasn ' t good enough for him to make films with good plots , laughs , snappy dialogue and good characters . it ' s almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off , here are some of the ones i noticed : < br / > < br / > the matrix , fight club , kill bill , the usual suspects , vanilla sky . . . < br / > < br / > i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors , jason statham and ray liotta , were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction that let the film down . < br / > < br / > so a big , big thumbs down from me . 
NEG look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie : connery , fishburne , capshaw , harris , underwood , beatty , thigpen , even cameos by slezak , lange , and plimpton . they prove , in spades , the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script . the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards . it ' s not particularly original , and the " twists " are downright cruel . 
NEG do you like stand up ? then stay away from this . . . < br / > < br / > during the early rounds , there are in fact good comics , but unless they got some cute qualities , they got a snowballs chance . any controversial material and you are out ! . . . and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians , when i see who the crooked judges are letting in . < br / > < br / > 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries . half + of the finalists have given me 0 laughs . several of them have lifted their material elsewhere , something the judges doesn ' t seem to have problems with . < br / > < br / > it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv , but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been . < br / > < br / > if the producers changed the name of the contest to " last clown standing " , all my criticism would loose validity . maybe an idea ? 
NEG years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes . for the uninitiated , john cassavettes was an actor , screen writer and director ( married to actress gena rowlands ) , nominated for oscars three times , who wrote and directed a variety of good low - budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat . up until seeing the incubus , we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him . had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether . but we did not walk out . at the time , my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made . now frankly , this is not true . i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax ( did i just say that out loud ? ) that are far worse than the incubus . almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus . certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus . however , i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall . when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better ( or worse ) than the incubus . < br / > < br / > http : / / thevillagevideot . blogspot . com / 
NEG a young couple mandy pullman ( mitch martin ) and roy seeley ( matt birman ) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of galen . they decide to start playing practical jokes on each other . mandy hides in an old run down cabin , she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant . roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed . dr . sam cordell ( john cassavetes ) and his daughter jenny ( erin flannery ) are both new to galen after the death of sam ' s wife . sam is called into action by police chief hank walden ( john ireland ) when mandy and roy are found . he performs the autopsy on roy and treats mandy for her horrific injuries . soon after a curator at the local museum named carolyn davis ( denise furgusson ) is also attacked and raped . a local journalist named laura kincaid ( kerrie keane ) reports the events and suggests to sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier . more rapes and murders occur . meanwhile jenny ' s boyfriend tim galen ( duncan macintosh ) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts . tim ' s story and digging into the towns past makes sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an incubus - a shape - shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce ! directed by john hough this is one seriously dull horror film . the script by george franklin based on the novel by ray russell is slow to say the least . nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending i ' ve ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly . as the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes , but none are shown on screen . there is only one gore scene in the entire film too . the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes . everything about this film production - wise is very static and flat , the film has no energy or pace . the acting is dull and you don ' t feel or care for anyone . check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions . the type of rubbish horror film making that you ' ll forget within a day . a real waste of time , don ' t bother . 
NEG stephen king adaptation ( scripted by king himself ) in which a young family , newcomers to rural maine , find out about the pet cemetery close to their home . the father ( dale midkiff ) then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right . < br / > < br / > below average " horror " picture starts out clumsy , insulting , and inept , and continues that way for a while , with the absolute worst element being midkiff ' s worthless performance . it gets a little better toward the end , with genuinely disturbing finale . in point of fact , the whole movie is really disturbing , which is why i can ' t completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable . decent supporting performances by fred gwynne , as the wise old aged neighbor , and brad greenquist , as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem film . < br / > < br / > king has his usual cameo as the minister . < br / > < br / > followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert ( is it any wonder that she ' s had no mainstream film work since ? ) . < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 
NEG there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie . they took a sleazy story , miscast it , miswrote it , misfilmed it . it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story . < br / > < br / > as badly as it fails as art , it fails even worse as commerce . who could have been the target market for this . what age group ? what interest group ? < br / > < br / > someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie . that i would pay to see . < br / > < br / > i ' ve seen thousands of bad movies , and this ranks with " sailor who fell from grace " and " manos " . . . my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies i ' ve ever seen . everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with vandamme for all eternity . < br / > < br / > i challenge you . watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse ? i can ' t think of one way . 
NEG i wasn ' t as " lucky " as some of the others commenting on this film : i have never seen anything else out of the . . . shall we say . . . " fecund " mind of sarno . i agree with many : some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and ( go - go ) dancing are not really that attractive . i kinda liked fraulein crank ( ? ) . . . she was so homely , she was cute ! the acting was pretty stale , also , though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem . trying to follow the plot was a major chore : was there one , really ? i do heartily agree with one other comment : for a vampire movie , there ' s not much blood . yep , if you want good bloodsucking flicks , check out such hammer classics as " horror of dracula " and ( my personal favourite ) " brides of dracula " . < br / > < br / > the most ( unintentionally ) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats . . . which you never see ! . . . the bats , i mean . < br / > < br / > okay as a time - waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the great white north but , for heaven ' s sake , don ' t rent it ! 
NEG umm . . i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks . < br / > < br / > lets face it . . . tori spelling is not a great actress . . and this movie just proves the extent of her " talent " . the movie ' s plot was weak . . . i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom . if there is a good thing about this movie , i would say it ' s that tommy chong ' s daughter , just for the fact that she ' s his daughter . . . and then there is that soap - opera - ish male lead who ' s decent good looks somewhat make him attractive , but ceases to help his dramatic abilities . * why does imdb require at least 10 lines ? how many more ways can you simply say " this movie sucks " ? 
NEG what ends up killing this movie is its self - consciousness , among other things . here ' s a short list : 1 . irreverent behavior . when the beatles came over and injected their brand of " quirky , irreverent " behavior / humor , it was greeted as fresh . that was over 4 decades ago . get over it . < br / > < br / > 2 . false sophistication . spewing out base , quasi - socio - political - isms is hard ground to make work comically . ask woody allen . < br / > < br / > 3 . the post - modern " i ' m hard on this phony world and yes , i recognize it in myself " snake eating itself - used as illustration with another animal in the film itself ! - is such a retread . < br / > < br / > 4 . smarmy , smug drollness . < br / > < br / > 5 . amateurish writing , acting , direction . . . ever seen student films ? a victim of itself , about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself , and sheesh , now i ' m getting caught up in the self - reflexive thing that it posits as worthwhile , of value . < br / > < br / > but towards . . . what ? ultimately , it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hey , ever see woody allen ' s take on bergman , ie : " interiors " ? ? ? well , this just does it more amateurishly . 
NEG n . b . : spoilers within . assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that director ' s mind . but directing a wagner opera is an especially tricky task , as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold . hans - jurgen syberberg loads this filming of " parsifal , " wagner ' s final masterpiece , with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams . you get more than a piece of the director : you get the whole fatted hog and then some . syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of german history . but does it work to meld that desire to a wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts ? < br / > < br / > the scenes with the knights of the holy grail in acts i and iii are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism . these are drawn come from wagner ' s own time , from long before , and go well beyond . if you know what these things mean , they can enrich syberberg ' s vision for you ( but not necessarily enhance wagner ' s vision ) ; if you don ' t know what they mean , they ' re simply confusing , if not annoying . i won ' t bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here . suffice it to say it is a typical wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements , in this case a blending of the holy grail legend with the principles , practices , and pageantry of christianity . the theme of redemption plays the main role here , as in nearly every wagner opera . < br / > < br / > i personally had to sweat to get through syberberg ' s first act ( amidst my jarring acclimation , the music saved the day ) . but act ii picks up the pace . here we meet klingsor , the evil sorcerer , out to entrap the wandering " innocent fool " parsifal . the greatest seductress of them all , kundry , will be used to entice him to the dark side . after an initial dalliance with more symbols , these get stripped away , and the long , gorgeous , transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off . finally the film starts working a genuine magic , and it is chiefly due to syberberg ' s choosing to set things naturally and simply . suddenly the acting starts to work ( the expressive actress edith clever and the luscious soprano of yvonne minton team to create a wondrous kundry ) ; suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters . the camera work stays simple and quietly fluid . in other words , wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms . and it works beautifully . for me it was the most engrossing part of the film . < br / > < br / > with the re - entrance of the knights in part 2 of act iii , the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in . some other loony syberberg ideas : using a huge wagner death - mask as a major set - piece ( causing the composer ' s protuberant proboscis to loom comically large ) ; dressing the act iii knights in all manner of costumes , wigs , and makeup ( what is the director saying ? that the knights are a bunch of buffoons ? that they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions ? it ' s anybody ' s guess ) ; the insertion  just after the incredibly touching baptism of kundry by parsifal  of rear - projection footage of the conductor rehearsing , in modern - day realism , his orchestra in the studio ( this completely snapped my dramatic thread , requiring a few minutes to regroup ) ; the complete avoidance of having any time pass between acts ii and iii ( when we meet the knight and " narrator " gurnemanz again , he should be an old , old man , and parsifal should re - emerge as a world - weary but wiser middle - aged man ) ; but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the parsifal character into male / female components . some find this the most brilliant stroke . no doubt i can credit karin krick , who plays " parsifal 2 , " with acting of strength and dignity ( she also happens to be the best lip - syncher of the whole cast ) . but please . . . wagner ' s conception of parsifal is already so complex . his growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past , to his breakthrough realization in act ii of what amfortas ' s eternal wound means and how it has become his own , to his return as the great redeemer of act iii  this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character . the bi - sexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd . ( and what ' s with this nonsense about a homoerotic gurnemanz and parsifal ? ? can ' t we just accept a mentor / apprentice relationship , which is marvelously reversed in act iii ? ) < br / > < br / > the monte carlo philharmonic under armin jordan plays with passion and beauty ( though the chorus is disappointing ) . but after watching this film i only wanted to whip out my solti - led recording ( highly recommended ) and get my wagnerian bearings straight again . the film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating . to syberberg ' s credit , he ' s created a visually arresting work , and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera . but instead of sticking to " parsifal , " he seems to have wanted to bring in all things wagnerian : the man , the life , the enormous influence . . . all of it in crude symbolic code . " parsifal " the opera is already full of weighty symbolism : the grail , the spear , the holy sacraments , baptism , amfortas ' s ever - bleeding wound , klingsor ' s self - castration , the kiss , kundry ' s curse , and on and on . this is not to mention the * musical * symbolism sounding constantly in the score , in the form of wagner ' s leitmotif system . " parsifal " itself is one huge symbol ! getting back to my first - paragraph question , syberberg ' s whole hog is all way too much for me . but if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy , then go for it . i won ' t recommend just staying away from this ; you may find yourself heartily satisfied . or if you need something to crack your wagner barrier , try it . . . but please , please , don ' t stop here . " parsifal " is in a late , very ripe league of its own . 
NEG i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation . but the simplicity and " intelligence " of this film were boring . i ' ve often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point . now that i ' ve seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines . there ' s tones about society , racism , and some desire . . . but south park has that . and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion . the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes . i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film . i gave this film a one . 
NEG this movie sucks from beginning till ( especially ) the end . you probably don ' t get ' m any worse , acting , storyline , photography , camera work , etcetera it ' s all bad , very , very bad . < br / > < br / > but that ' s what makes it a ' great ' watch , it will give you more than enough good laughs . the worse , the better ! < br / > < br / > i really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie . a serious viking movie ? the story is goddamn ridiculous , it ' s more like a comedy in disguise , kinda like mafia , also pointless but damn funny . < br / > < br / > and look out for the very very end of the movie . . . uhum . 
NEG recap : according to legend , the valkyrie brunhilda defied odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire . only a warrior pure in heart can pass through the flames , free brunhilda and release her from odin ' s claim , and have her for himself . now , war is brewing in the norse lands , and the king needs an alliance with the berserkers . the berserkers are warriors claimed by odin ' s valkyries , lusting for war , blood and flesh , and therefore outcasts , but superior in battle . the leader of the berserkers is a scorned son of the king , boar , and his price for the alliance is his brother , the future king , barek . but after the king is victorious in battle , he refuses to give up his only remaining son , breaking his oath to boar and betray him and kill him . boar is saved only by barek ' s call upon odin . but this is only the start of the battle between the brothers , and their final battle is about to start now , a millennia later . . . < br / > < br / > comments : i had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some viking ground , far too little quality movie about viking has been done . it started out very good too , with detailed longships and armors , nice and fitting sceneries and an ok battle . < br / > < br / > the foundation in the aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me . odin is much more vengeful , spiteful and absent than i remind him from school , and the valkyries has been turned into some vampire - demons . i ' m no expert , but that seems outright wrong . < br / > < br / > but the fatal mistake made by this movie is to move the time - setting from the original time - period to today . if the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time , with some decent battles , this movie would have been much better . now the setting , suddenly is changed to present day stockholm . still , odin is present and is sending boar and his berserkers for brunhilda and barek which gives silly scenes when armor - clad and painted berserkers swordfights with barek among the industries . beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement . and when allowed to focus upon single fights , instead of massive battles as in the beginning , i quickly saw that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy . < br / > < br / > the end result is thin story , sometimes hard to follow and other times just silly , and the only that could save it , the action , is drawn from slow , dull and clumsy swordfights . it draws very little from aesir myth or viking tradition . thus both story and action fails , and the movie is just plain bad . < br / > < br / > finally , as a swede , this movie is a little confusing . supposedly filmed entirely in south africa , it still contains some familiar swedish signs , plates and what seems to be an authentic police car . however , the effort is poor and only goes so far , as to really set it in sweden . no names are swedish ( perhaps with anya as the exception ) , no familiar sceneries are swedish , they ( supposedly ) speak a little ( ancient ? ) norwegian , not swedish . and uniforms , both police and medical , are clearly not swedish . if they were not going to even try to do it correctly - and really give the illusion that it is set in sweden , why bother at all ? < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 
NEG i was expecting a very funny movie . instead , i got a movie with a few funny jokes , and many that just didn ' t work . i didn ' t like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes ' and moriarty ' s descendants . it was confusing . it would have been more funny if they just had someone new , instead of moriarty resurrected . some of the things were funny . burt kwouk was very funny , as always . mccloud on the horse was funny . the mcgarrett from hawaii 5 - 0 was not even mcgarrett - like . connie booth obviously is very good with accents . she is from indiana , but played english and a new yorker pretty well . unfortunately , she was not presented much into the script . i was expecting a more funny film . instead , i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script . rather ironic , since both booth and cleese were together on this one . maybe they were about to break up in 77 . 
NEG oh my , i think this may be the single cheesiest movie i ' ve ever seen . i ' m serious , this is one of the ultimate b - movies . the first proof is that it isn ' t a $ 5 dvd . oh no , that ' s too mainstream for this . i got this on vhs , from a bin full of ex - rental videos at my local video store . < br / > < br / > if i may quote the blurb : " in 17th century japan , there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages . his name was mayeda . he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5 , 000 muscats from the king of spain . whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives . mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan . " it then goes on to say " a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents " < br / > < br / > i must have seen a different movie . this was no epic , and it certainly wasn ' t a multi million dollar anything . no , ' shogun mayeda ' is really just the crazy adventures of the engrish - speaking mayeda ( sho kosugi ) . he isn ' t even a shogun really , but thats not important . what is important , is that he does a really cool impression of john cleese ' s repeated charging of the one castle in ' monty python and the holy grail ' , and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers . awesome . < br / > < br / > the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugi ' s engrish accent . the movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie , but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever , delivered by the coolest engrish accent ever . and honestly , do you really want anything else ? you could fast forward ' shogun mayeda ' to the end , and replay kosugi ' s final line over and over . the tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line . awesome . < br / > < br / > 2 / 10 - so very very cheesy . 
NEG whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point . jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy . < br / > < br / > this giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles . there is not one decent performance in it . . even the usually reliable jasper carrott is painfully unfunny . < br / > < br / > the american bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon . < br / > < br / > maud adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing . all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable . she is not . kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better . < br / > < br / > i ' ve flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet . avoid 
NEG waldemar daninsky ( paul naschy ) travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti , which causes him to become a werewolf . he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover , and is later revived by a female scientist , dr . ilona ermann , who uses him in mind control experiments . daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor ' s failed experiments . < br / > < br / > upon hearing of naschy ' s death from colleague jon kitley , i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch . in my scramble , i found i own not one but three ( ! ) copies of " fury of the wolfman " . the film is of questionable video quality , the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion , the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times . and the american versions have two love scenes removed . quite frankly , without a remastered , uncut copy , i wasn ' t really getting the proper movie in all its glory . < br / > < br / > this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky . i suspect this is true , but you wouldn ' t know this from the film itself . the plot is confusing at times , and there ' s really no indication that this is a sequel . if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box , you ' ll see that i ' m not alone in my confusion . < br / > < br / > perhaps the film ' s shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through . while floating around for years , it was only released in 1973 , due to problems involved in finding a distributor . and naschy said in his autobiography that the director , zabalza , was an incompetent alcoholic , and that he hated working with him . those really aren ' t light accusations , and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf . < br / > < br / > chances are , sooner or later you ' ll come across a low - grade version of " fury of the wolfman " . it appears in a variety of three - packs and box sets , so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know . what really needs to happen is an american uncut version , with a decent sound and video mix , and the love scenes thrown back in . as far as i know , this does not exist . let us honor paul naschy ' s legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves . 
NEG note : i will reveal a key part of the plot , but if you ' ve looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material , you ' ll already know it . < br / > < br / > this movie seems to have been written by an eleven - year - old who isn ' t very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it . the writer doesn ' t know the difference between a chemical and an organism . < br / > < br / > forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary . forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don ' t wear protective gear ( not even gloves ) . these are quibbles in the context of this movie . in the scientific world within this story , 2 + 2 = 6 . 34 and gravity goes sideways . < br / > < br / > the fact is that the people in this movie do not ( with a few exceptions ) behave the way human beings behave . almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate . the love story ( of course there is one ) makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare . < br / > < br / > i can ' t believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing . 
NEG baba - rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life . this is the movie which caused his downfall . it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors . rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred . soon after its release , he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably . its a very bad movie with horrible acting , bad - quality makeup and pathetic screenplay . throughout the movie , rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease . i ' m one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba , first day first show in theatre . the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission . sorry , i ' ll not recommend this one to anyone . 
NEG the king is dead long live the king ! the triad of caddie shack two , the family underneath the stairs , and troop beverly hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right . but there is a new king . . . . . yep . . . . . all hail the new king . . . . " down to earth " . but some things , like tiny tim for example , are so bad they are good . some day this could take out the inimitable " rocky horror picture show " as a cult film . so go see this . . . . this . . . . well just take my word for it . go see it . all hail the new king ! 
NEG chris rock deserves better than he gives himself in " down to earth . " as directed by brothers chris & paul weitz of " american pie " fame , this uninspired remake of warren beatty ' s 1978 fantasy " heaven can wait , " itself a rehash of 1941 ' s " here comes mr . jordan , " lacks the abrasively profane humor that won chris rock an emmy for his first hbo special . predictably , he spouts swear words from a to z , but he consciously avoids the f - word . anybody who saw this gifted african - american comic in " lethal weapon 4 , " " dogma , " or " nurse betty " knows he can elicit more laughter with the f - word than martin lawrence and eddie murphy put together . sadly , despite a few witty one - liners , " down to earth " hits rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance . < br / > < br / > " down to earth " utterly destroys any good will that the weitz brothers generated with their landmark gross - out face " american pie . " this disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable color - blind interracial romance . unfortunately , a more than competent cast  among them " the full monty ' s " mark addy , chazz palminteri of " analyze this , " " sctv ' s " eugene levy , and newcomer brian rhodes as charles wellington , jr .  are wasted in flat - footed , sketchy roles . hardcore rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken . abysmally written by lance crouther , ali le roi , louis ck , and rock , " down to earth " casts chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the big apple and gets booed off the stage at night in harlem ' s celebrated apollo theatre . poor lance barton ( chris rock ) suffers from severe stage fright . nevertheless , his charitable manager whitney daniels ( frankie faison of " hannibal " ) sticks with him through thick and thin . after lance learns the apollo theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza , he implores whitney to get him in the line - up . excuse me , but if lance is such a deadbeat stand - up comic , why does the apollo keep inviting him back ? meanwhile , fate has something else in store for lance . while pedaling home on his bike , our protagonist spots a pretty lady , sontee ( regina king of " jerry maguire " ) , crossing the street , but he doesn ' t see the bus that collides with him and kills him . wham ! lance barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head . in heaven , which resembles a cruise ship nightclub , lance learns that an overzealous angel , mr . keyes ( eugene levy of " stay tuned " ) , timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule . < br / > < br / > heavenly honcho mr . king ( chazz palminteri of " analyze this " ) , god ' s right - hand guy , apologizes and escorts lance back to earth . the snag is lance cannot reclaim his corpse , so he must inhabit another body . the best that mr . keyes can come up with is ruthless , white , 60 - year old tycoon charles wellington . wellington ' s adulterous wife amber ( jennifer coolidge of " american pie " ) and his unscrupulous personal aide winston ( greg germann of " sweet november " ) have just tried to poison him . reluctantly , before wellington ' s body vanishes , lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until keyes can locate a more appropriate body . meanwhile , lance - as - wellington encounters sontee again . she is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor . while regina king brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker , she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with wellington . although he is no longer black , lance not only tries to woo sontee but also win a gig at the apollo . < br / > < br / > " down to earth " features rock in his most unfunny role . the comedian ' s reason for making this movie seems questionable . reportedly , he ate lunch with warren beatty and told beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist elaine may had penned for beatty . initially , beatty tried the race - reversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast muhammad ali in the title role of " heaven can wait . " the deal fell through , and beatty headlined the movie himself . according to rock , his longtime co - writers and he thought that they could ' annihilate ' this classic . moreover , he justified his choice of " heaven can wait " based on his philosophy to " do something you can only do when you ' re hot . " earlier , rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers , because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing . as a lifeless comedian in " down to earth , " rock doesn ' t so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst ! this half - baked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the weitz brothers ! you know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes , only the laughter . similarly , the casting of mark addy as wellington ' s butler who speaks the queen ' s english but is in reality a commoner from michigan defies logic , too . addy is an actual englishman , and he doesn ' t have to fake an accent ; his accent is genuine . the major overriding quandary with " down to earth " is the on - again - off - again , look - a - like switcheroo that the characters make so chris rock doesn ' t disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds . although chris spends half the movie as white guy wellington , audiences see him largely as lance , undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky , bald - headed , caucasian white , alter - ego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hip - hop lyrics . incredibly , rock served double - duty as the film ' s executive producer and one of its four scribes . the mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward , misguided muddle of a comedy . about the only redeeming feature of " down to earth " is jamshied sharifi ' s superb orchestral film score . 
NEG a truly muddled incomprehensible mess . most things in the film look more or less like 1987 , but then there are futuristic things just thrown in , like the policeman ' s ray gun . and that car ! the director seemed to be in love with colored lights . the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie , but since there was no cast listing , i don ' t know which actress that was . this one is worth missing . grade : f 
NEG devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it ' s on the dpp ' video nasty ' list , but it really needn ' t have been . many films on the list where there for god ( and dpp ) only known reasons , and while this isn ' t the tamest of the bunch ; there isn ' t a lot here that warrants banning . . . which is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it ' s on ' the shopping list ' . the plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle . a hunter is then hired to find her , but along the way he has to brave the natives , lead by a man who calls himself " the devil " ( hence the title ) . the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren ' t many scenes of interest . it ' s a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent ; as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z , venus in furs , faceless and she kills in ecstasy , but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap . i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i ' ve seen everything on the dpp ' s list ( just two more to go ! ) , and i ' m guessing that ' s why most other people who have seen it , saw it . but if you ' re not on the lookout for nasties ; there really is no reason to bother with this one . 
NEG i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so long . . . . and unfortunately , it wasn ' t worth it ! even for a die hard lynch fan , i found this to be really tedious . . . . < br / > < br / > nothing happens , there are long , long , long painful pauses where nothing happens , long , monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing , or caring , what the hell it was all about , what happened before and what happened afterward . < br / > < br / > there was a mulholland drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita - esque , and a lost highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , it ' s all very uninteresting and very dull , nothing happens , it ' s very forgettable and i think i will delete it from my computer and forget i ever watched it . sorry david ! 
NEG the french film " extension du domaine de la lutte " directed by iconoclast film maker philippe harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer michel houellebecq . he has also worked on this film ' s scenario . according to british cinema magazine sight and sound , it is also known as " whatever " . this film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers . the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character . this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read . the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend . instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall . beware : some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists . 
NEG the recent boom of dating show on u . s . television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of " the bachelor . " unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations , including " the bachelorette " , " joe millionaire " , " for love or money " , and the execrable " married by america . " hoping to cash in on this trend , and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic , bravo has unleashed the disastrous " boy meets boy " upon the world . and may they have mercy on us all . < br / > < br / > the premise is simple and is designed to be light - hearted : an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors , eliminated show by show until one is left , but there ' s a twist . half of the men are actually straight . this is not much of a big deal , but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay - off : if , at the end of the show , the gay man picks a straight man in disguise , the straight man wins a cash prize . the gay man gets nothing , or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts , a pat on the back , and a hearty round of " aren ' t you embarrassed ? well , thanks for playing ! " < br / > < br / > just the like the equally painful " queer eye for the straight guy " ( another bravo program ) , this show is another example of stereotypes run amok . what makes it even worse , though , is the fact that straight men are playing up these stereotypes for cash . the producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a man ' s hair , dress up in abercrombie & fitch with a pair of designer sandals , strip him of all body hair and fat and voila ! it ' s the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface , and just as offensive to those of us - - like myself - - who are genuinely gay and don ' t dress / act like that . it implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality , that they can ' t behave like real people , only like stereotypes . never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity . all are gym - toned , most are white , and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned . < br / > < br / > this is another example of how , instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change , hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank . i feel genuinely dirty watching this show , as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of soft - core pornography masquerading as legitimate television . 1 out of 10 . 
NEG and that is the only reason i posses this dvd . now i haven ' t seen the first nemesis film , but i did check the info out of it and i here by say : what ? why ? because in the first film alex was male . but then again the first one was set in the future , so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time . who knows , at least it wasn ' t addressed in the film in any way . < br / > < br / > here ' s a quick summary of the plot : alex , still a baby then ( or how ever you want , as it was , is , in the future ) escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80 ' s africa . there mommy gets killed and alex ( sue price ) grows up in a african tribe . then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg . so there . does sound familiar , doesn ' t it ? . < br / > < br / > terminator isn ' t the only film being ripped here , predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie , the vincent price one , gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from . < br / > < br / > lets see , what else ? okay , the film was quite standard small budget flick , but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90 ' s film . it would have looked okay for a 80 ' s flick how ever . biggest problem is the plot . things just happen and the viewer is barely interested . nemesis 2 isn ' t the crappiest piece of cinema i ' ve had pleasure ( ? ) to watch but it does come damn close . < br / > < br / > i won ' t say a thing about acting , because let ' s be honest here : did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here ? oh well . . . at least i did find sue price hot in that amazonian warrior way . < br / > < br / > a " real " movie rating : 2 / 10 there isn ' t a lot of pros about the over all quality . and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense . < br / > < br / > a camp movie rating : 4 / 10 i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film , so it does have small merits in it . 
NEG as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film , i found this to be a very disappointing movie . < br / > < br / > yes , it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the ( highly ) morally dubious premise . however , it fails abysmally in the important areas . < br / > < br / > there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclair ' s generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries - possibly in free computers . . . or possibly not . vague , long - winded and inconclusive . the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical . the film feels half - finished . < br / > < br / > suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher ( maria doyle kennedy ) can be drawn to gordon sinclair ' s unimpressive character , especially when he fends off her advances . laughable . it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value . < br / > < br / > not many films leave me feeling cheated , but i felt my time was stolen . 
NEG i ' d heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd . there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we ' d both heard that this was a terrifying film , really scary . how disappointed was i ? ? very ! ! ! ! apart from that one scene ( we all know which bit ) nothing happened ! ! ! i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes , like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something . < br / > < br / > nearly all the reviews here say what a scary , gripping , atmospheric movie this is . i just didn ' t see it i ' m afraid . maybe there ' s a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in britain . < br / > < br / > a big let down after all the hyped reviews : ( 
NEG " a guy thing " tries to capture the feeling of " there ' s something about mary " or " meet the parents " but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting - room rejects of those two films . thankfully i rented it on a 5 - day rental because i couldn ' t sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time . < br / > < br / > the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul ' s missteps ( the checker at the save - mart was great ) but the script - writing is absolutely horrible . the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight - gag is stuck in for no good reason . plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need ? < br / > < br / > don ' t get me wrong , slapstick humor is great when it ' s smartly done as in the other films i mentioned , but this movie simply misses the mark . too bad as i love julia stiles ( ten things i hate about you was great ) but even that couldn ' t help me sit through this terrible movie . save your dollars and go rent " there ' s something about mary " one more time . 
NEG this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin . < br / > < br / > the vhs box said it was rated " r " but the into on the actual tape inside said it was " x . " the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking . even in the dark , you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy - and , yes , you could see his penis in her mouth . i read somewhere that this was the first time where a " mainline actress " had done something like this on screen . < br / > < br / > detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body . she looked beautiful . unfortunately , the movie is ugly . . . . a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers ' looks . 
NEG it ' s hard to believe that in 1997 david duchovny was at the top of his fame , with x - files , one of the best sci - fi series ever , being at the top of the glory . nine years later he is almost forgotten , and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably . i cannot even explain why , he is a fair actor , but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from . < br / > < br / > at the same time angelina jolie was much less known , and she was really lucky that a film like ' playing god ' did not led her career into a dead - end . fortunately for her , ' the bone collector ' and ' girl , interrupted ' were waiting beyond the corner , and when lara croft came , her career was launched . < br / > < br / > there is not too much to be told about this film . it ' s the only big screen film of andy wilson , and there must be a reason . all is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex - doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob . the off - screen voice is especially bad , with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film . you probably will not meet the film but in dvd rental stores , or on tv . try to look for something better . 
NEG this is not the video nastie , but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain . it is 75 % a rehash of the boogeyman , and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was . < br / > < br / > i was initially confused as i thought that annie ( kelly galindo ) may have been a different lacey , but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film . fans will immediately note that they are not the same person . < br / > < br / > after seeing a murder in a bathroom , and also seeing the address as well , annie , her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials , head to the house , and , sure enough , it ' s the same bathroom . 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described . of course , we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered . < br / > < br / > then the movie shift to a rerunning of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original . notably , the boogeyman is shown unlike the original . sadly , some of the good scenes were cut , but 90 % of it is there . why rerun this film ? did they find the footage in the trash ? what was the purpose ? < br / > < br / > we ' ll never know and , despite the psychologist telling annie she is cured , we all know the bogeyman will never die . 
NEG give me my money back ! give me my life back ! give me a bit of credit . this movie was vomit worthy . useless and time consuming . what a waste of energy and totally pointless . okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but , give us a break ! next time just give me the money and let me spend it . lost child , mothers remorse , blamed husband ! cliché yes ~ ! get a life ! sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time , my money and my being . i would rather watch eggs cook ! no real explanation to why this happened . prison ? why ? loss ? obvious but why ? acting deserves a what am i doing here oscar and the cinematography a am i just doing this for a wage ? how much did this movie make ? well this silly fool hired a copy . enough said 
NEG for the love of god please don ' t see this movie ! its a waste of time , the plot is predictable , as are the romantic scenes . trying to build too much with very little , this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame . the characters aren ' t developed , and most of the film is padded out with shots of rome , which is much more interesting than the actual film . to top all of that , the acting is a disgrace . i know everyone tries to find their niche , but this is truly a disaster . i can ' t believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen . don ' t waste money or time on this film , go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead . 
NEG can you say " all shock , no plot ? " there were so many unexplored directions in this movie . there was no history about the room other than the deaths . * why * was it evil ? what made it that way ? why an " hour " countdown ? then , there were the unexplored things hinted at ; for example we * saw * a camera in the air vent , which he mentioned . but when he climbed up said vent , there was no camera . < br / > < br / > how about the fact that all the ghosts looked " digital " , and things " winked out " before hitting the ground making a static noise ? hmmm . . . when you put all of * those * things together , it makes room 1408 look like a high - tech spook house . except that there was no follow up on that . < br / > < br / > oh . . . by the way . . . electronics don ' t work in 1408 . well , except for the tv . . . the cell phone has no signal , but wireless internet works fine . how many incontinuities can you possibly add ? i ' m sorry , but this film was nothing but " shock after shock " . it ' s all been done before . reflections in the mirror . things just out of site . changing paintings . bleeding walls . the " oh , it was all just a dream . . . no it wasn ' t . " and , if the room was " evil " , why make our main character come to terms with his daughter ' s death , if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway ? it just didn ' t make sense . < br / > < br / > additionally , there was no background information about " the first book " that he wrote . just some vague information about the " dad was a jerk " and so forth . speaking of dads , what was with the bit about his father ? " you ' ll be in my place " . < br / > < br / > overall , a truly horrible movie . it was 100 % adrenalin shock factor , without any new or innovative effects , and certainly no back story , character development , etc . < br / > < br / > my overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the " cheap " ; pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots , and was nothing but an effects film of recycled , cheesy , " seen - that - before " effects . 
NEG the social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable . nothing has changed in fitz ' s personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting . < br / > < br / > i even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in england . can he not insinuate himself on the australian police ? it seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation . < br / > < br / > the latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible , sometimes bordering on silliness , and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one . sad . 
NEG for every series that makes it to television , a 100 ideas are formed , 50 scripts are written , 15 pilots are made , and one , just one , actually makes it to production . from such a selection process , we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop , for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series . < br / > < br / > and so it goes with true blood ; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea , a screen play , a pilot , and finally a series . unfortunately , it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings . oh how wrong they so often are . . . < br / > < br / > true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines , worst acting , and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history . its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents . alan ball ' s not so secret desires for ryan ( jason stackhouse ) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline . tara ' s angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the confedercy . sam finds suppressed love for sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning , noon , and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship . < br / > < br / > as for bill the vampire , his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her ( although she remains somewhat unharmed ) . we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy meals with legs . < br / > < br / > despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes , i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show , its still bad . somethings die for a reason , even vampires . maybe this show should to . 
NEG almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this . the dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less ( or should have been ) . this is also backed - up by odd scenes ( e . g . the cemetry slow - motion walk ) that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life . < br / > < br / > the plot is a strange combination of gangster / situation comedy which i am sure seemed a good idea at the time but if ever there was a case for someone needing to be honest with the scriptwriter then here was it . < br / > < br / > martin freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character which always plays so i am beginning to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told to react as normal . < br / > < br / > finally - humour . this reminds me of the ' python ( i think ) quote about shakespere , of his ' comedies ' - if he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it . well i didn ' t see one . < br / > < br / > don ' t waste your time - i did because i was watching it with a friend and kept hoping that it was going to get better . < br / > < br / > it didn ' t . 
NEG possibly not , but it is awful . even the fantastic cast cant save it . ok , i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house . bill murray turned from being a quick witted , humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren ' t funny , its like he was trying too hard to be funny . his character stole a weapon ( an rv ? come on . . . ) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers , for a laugh . one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are , albeit unintentionally . i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released . 
NEG . . . through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze . a not - particularly talented director has helmed a not - particularly good movie , yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits , if for nothing more than to see what happens next . < br / > < br / > a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame . after capturing her ( even though she came willingly ) and threatening her into having sex ( another event she was also willing to do ) he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past . he then decides to kill her ( huh ? ) but is foiled and dies instead . the girl ' s mind snaps ( or something like that ) and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement . < br / > < br / > alright , the writing sucks : it ' s long winded , loaded with ten - cent words and there is way too much of it . < br / > < br / > the acting sucks : what a minute , what acting ? < br / > < br / > the filming sucks : home video is bad enough , but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult . < br / > < br / > and the budget is a joke : get it . . . ' budget ' , that was the punchline . < br / > < br / > and yet there was a charm to the thing . back in the 70 ' s these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them , not in this day and age though . if you want to watch this kind of violent , sexually exploitive trash ( don ' t lie , some of us do ) then this is all your gonna get nowadays . < br / > < br / > some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene , torture with fecal material , fun with axes , anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu . < br / > < br / > it ' s not good and it won ' t be remembered , but not since the heyday of joe d ' amato have people made movies like this . < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 
NEG i watch bad movies . < br / > < br / > this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie . not an ounce of humor , not an ounce of talent throughout . < br / > < br / > i am lazy . < br / > < br / > usually , i see a bad movie and curse . this was so bad , i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to . < br / > < br / > i am smashing my copy of this movie . < br / > < br / > it ' s too lame even to use clear a room . so boring . watch ' bloodsucking freaks ' or ' shock , shock , shock ' for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment . this sludge looks awful , is awful , and whoever made it should feel awful . 
NEG this was a classic case of something that should never have been . gloria was now a single mother , her husband had left her because she wouldn ' t live in some commune with him ( he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society ) . right then and there i had problems with the series - come on , i say to myself , is this the same noble michael stivic that countered archie bunker ' s right winged philosophies ? the series went on , but it just didn ' t have any pizazz . whatever momentum sally struthers gained from all the family was long gone . maybe , if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family , it might have worked out . ah well , that ' s show business . 
NEG can only be described as awful . it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad . when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but fear not because it does . another poorly written script for a donkey director for no - talent offspring of past movie stars . it ' s hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both . as for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it . and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete - doesn ' t even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies . this is a really ridiculous movie . lucky it only cost me $ 1 to hire . 
NEG think of a no - budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and you ' ll get ' power play . ' the idea was good , but the execution , acting , and dialog absolutely killed it , not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie . < br / > < br / > this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake . the rather cavalier reporter , going up against what should ' ve been a more ruthless bunch of company execs , is chased around town ( along with anyone he speaks to ) in order to " clean " whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant ' s faults . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy , coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting . not to mention , the viewer , who may only be attracted to the movie for it ' s action genre appeal , is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em - ups plus earthquake disaster scenes . all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should ' ve propelled the story . it might ' ve been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller , and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story . creepy villains , a naive reporter , and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong - doing afoot . it is formulaic , but at least it would ' ve been entertaining . 
NEG i honestly have to say that i could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started . simply for how bad it was ! ! ! it ' s kinda like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing . i mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen , anything in fact , preferably something that makes the whole film make sense ! at the end of the film i actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that i may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether i may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plot ( if there was in fact one ) together ! the main thing that really confused me about this movie , is nearly at the end the main girl ( if there was indeed a main girl ) was in some sort of alternate reality , i mean what the hell was going on at this point ? ! all of a sudden she awoke and was in a mental institute , chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something , then quicker than it would have taken me to slit my wrists , it flipped back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampire ! it made no sodding sense ! i ' m tempted to email the makers and demand my time back , i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish ! i am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about ! just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been 4hrs long to make that happen ! i side completely with the other person who wrote the other review , i was duped royally with this film by its title , and that alone . i ' m just so sodding grateful i didn ' t actually buy the film , no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop . you would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest i think £ 1 was way too much money to spend on this film ! ! ! ! what a sodding huge waste of time and a good razor blade , i mean i wish i od ' ed , its less painful than watching this film ! ! ! ! 
NEG in this strangely - lackadaisical apocalypse , the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires , but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade - z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu ' s famous short novel than my mother ' s lasagna recipe . bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it . the plot , and i use that term loosely , involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with " the general , " whose daughter is missing , at a church to kill a vampire who , very conveniently , happens to be traveling with the father and daughter . i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor . the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested . anyone older beware . 
NEG david arquette is a young and naive home security alarm < br / > < br / > salesman taken under the wing of stanley tucci . arquette is a < br / > < br / > golden boy , scoring a big sale on his first call - to widow kate < br / > < br / > capshaw and her dopey son ryan reynolds . things are going < br / > < br / > well for arquette , he is appearing in commercials for the security < br / > < br / > firm and he is falling in love with capshaw . < br / > < br / > then tucci and his right hand woman mary mccormack let him in < br / > < br / > on a little secret - they sometimes break into the houses of their < br / > < br / > clients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy < br / > < br / > security systems from the firm . arquette decides not to get < br / > < br / > involved , taking capshaw to meet his family , and going through life < br / > < br / > with a goofy smile on his face . then , someone breaks into < br / > < br / > capshaw ' s home and murders her and her son . arquette suspects tucci , and sets a series of traps , resulting in a gun to his < br / > < br / > boss ' head as tucci pleads his innocence . < br / > < br / > based on a stage play , " the alarmist " is not opened up well . the < br / > < br / > scenes where arquette takes the capshaw to meet his parents < br / > < br / > are badly played and completely unfunny . they are also out of line < br / > < br / > with the character capshaw is playing , as she gets drunk and tells < br / > < br / > sexually explicit stories to arquette ' s mom michael learned . other < br / > < br / > than these scenes , capshaw is not given much to do , but she < br / > < br / > does a lot with the little she is given . < br / > < br / > stanley tucci , looking just like terry o ' quinn , is a riot as the < br / > < br / > security firm owner . he is a creep who really does not understand < br / > < br / > arquette ' s moral revulsion . however , when he turns into a < br / > < br / > sniveling whiner after arquette kidnaps him , he is hilarious . mary < br / > < br / > mccormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role , but < br / > < br / > she mostly stands around and agrees with tucci . ryan reynolds < br / > < br / > is too old to play a dumb teenager , but he is funny , especially < br / > < br / > telling his own explicit sexual story to arquette . < br / > < br / > the screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy too < br / > < br / > soon . capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated , < br / > < br / > except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can < br / > < br / > break into her house . capshaw and reynolds are in the film just < br / > < br / > to give arquette a reason to take revenge on tucci . < br / > < br / > arquette , who has proven he is a good actor , is awful here . he < br / > < br / > relies on the constipated mugging that got him through those < br / > < br / > at & t ads , and he is not a strong enough presence to build this < br / > < br / > weak film around . actually , reynolds might have been a better < br / > < br / > choice in the role . < br / > < br / > dunsky ' s direction is good , nothing that will win an oscar soon . < br / > < br / > christophe beck ' s light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir this < br / > < br / > film tries to be , and it is really catchy on top of that . < br / > < br / > despite the pluses , arquette ' s failure as a lead and the script ' s < br / > < br / > schizophrenic quality sinks the film . i do not recommend it . < br / > < br / > this is rated ( r ) for physical violence , gun violence , some gore , < br / > < br / > strong profanity , brief female nudity , sexual content , strong sexual < br / > < br / > references , and adult situations . 
NEG " i ' m a cartoon ! " " you ' re an illustration ! " what does that suppose to mean ? ! this plot could not be worse as a boy , who ' s afraid of everything , becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library . the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read , when a cheaper , and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts ! even the talents of macaulay culkin ( as the kid ) , christopher lloyd ( as the so predictable " that he ' s a the page master " librarian ) , could save this pointless film from the dull plot . even the voices of whoopi goldberg , patrick stewart , ( even ) leonard nimoy , or the hollywood god of voices , frank welker as the cartoon characters don ' t save it ever . i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies , because the bland animation makes the film worse , not improving the dull plot ! 
NEG ok , i like b movies . . . i know what b movies are supposed to represent . but this is just awful . i am amazed it got such a decent overall score . the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the ( mostly ) marginal splatter effects . don ' t get me wrong , gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me ( like the anal " probe " . . . that was great ! ) . < br / > < br / > i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder . c ' mon - rent a betacam at least , i ' ve seen porn with better production values ( and better acting as well ) . < br / > < br / > acting - sucked ! but not in the troma or full moon sort of way . < br / > < br / > story - contrived ! but thats what you get from films like these . very loose ! < br / > < br / > sets & props - sucked ! my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloween . < br / > < br / > dubbing and dialogue - sucked ! horrible voice acting ( i shouldn ' t even call it acting ) and every other word is " s * * t " or " f * * k " . < br / > < br / > there are tons of good classic and b rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down . do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap ! 
NEG this movie is awful . at the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can ' t get back . the " twist " ending is very contrived . the character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion . ninety minutes of preparation - - with the premise that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve - - is explained away in literally ninety seconds of " no we were just tricking you . " then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it ! " i will forgive you if you can forgive me , " is as upset as he gets . if someone took weeks to convince me i was about to die and then said " no , sorry , just fooling you " i would raise some serious hell . i don ' t feel bad about giving away the spoiler because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching . please save yourself and don ' t watch this movie . 
NEG men , do i love police movies filled with action , shooting , chases etcetera . < br / > < br / > boy , was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie . we ' ve seen it all before , the hostages , the bank , the surrounding . . . yet , 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some kevlar . < br / > < br / > not just a few shots , no , hundreds of shots . going back into the bank , where the dumb hostages didn ' t lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out . how stupid did the director think we ' d be . < br / > < br / > okay , the shots in between that fake a documentary were good , but after seeing the film i only got the thought : why didn ' t the police get a decent shooting course ? and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break . truly bad . 
NEG i didn ' t even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade : trinity , i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the ' crap ' that ' s blade , so i did my quick research : checked the scores on imdb & rottentomatoes for dracula : ascension , and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000 . i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeing . < br / > < br / > now let ' s take a quick personal recap here . i remember seeing dracula 2000 , and i remember not liking it at all , and then seeing the scores of dracula : ascension just lowered my expectations even more , but then again , i ' m the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself ( any movie ) so that i can form my own opinion . < br / > < br / > a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it ' s low budget , so because of that , i ' m going to have to ignore a lot of the v / fx and just figure it ' s going to compensated by story & acting , i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie ( jason london , roy schieder & jason scott lee ) < br / > < br / > oh geez this movie was cheesy ! but cheesy can be entertaining at least , i found it pretty fricken laughable , the bad audio synch from the re - recording of dialogue in a few scenes , the stupidity of the characters in this movie . sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things , luke even had a book on it , but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get ' infected ' ? nope , this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on . < br / > < br / > i also must ' ve blinked at some point , because i ' m not sure how ' dracula ' got clothes on his body , especially since he ' s big wild and angry & i figure if i was in that situation , i wouldn ' t want to be the one dressing him . < br / > < br / > so the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy it doesn ' t , instead it ' s a ' cliff hangar ' where i now get to wait for the 3rd installment ' legacy ' . oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies . 
NEG * * * possible spoilers * * * < br / > < br / > when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like , not too high , but not low either . this was nothing like i expected at all though , it seems to me like the movie makers couldn ' t make up their mind of what kind of movie to make . < br / > < br / > in the begining of the film it ' s somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting , but that ' ll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes . . . as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of times . < br / > < br / > the ending is the most ridiculous of all though , almost splatter / comedy . . . < br / > < br / > i ' m not saying it doesn ' t have some good scenes it ' s just that the film never becomes " whole " . < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 movie - man 
NEG " dracula ii : ascension " is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of dracula . when a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction , it ' s an offer they can hardly refuse . soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the vatican ! " dracula ii : ascension " is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws . the characters are one - dimensional and the acting is pretty average . there are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene , but there is not enough violence for my liking . the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense . so if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look . i prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from 60 ' s and early 70 ' s like " lips of blood " , " the brides of dracula " or " lemora : a child ' s tale of supernatural " to name only a few . 4 out of 10 . 
NEG don ' t get me wrong , the movie is beautiful , the shots are stunning , and the material is dramatic . however , it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done . < br / > < br / > bbc ' s planet earth was all of the above and more . it was subtle . it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death . there was tragedy and triumph , loss and gain . it was balanced . < br / > < br / > disney ' s edit of earth is none of this . they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about . they made it dramatic . they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us . they made predators evil . they made walruses evil . they showed every encounter as negative . it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded , but at the expense of the lesson of balance . the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive . < br / > < br / > i am all for preventing global warning , but this was over the top political and environmental junk . < br / > < br / > that ' s another thing , i went to see it on the big screen , but was disappointed in the picture quality . it looked better on my tv at home . < br / > < br / > if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture , go out and buy , rent , or borrow the bbc ' s planet earth series . it is better lessons , better sound , and ( if you have blu - ray ) better picture quality . 
NEG typical thriller , has been done many times before . simple plot outline ; cop liotta becomes obsessed with russell ' s wife , and he tries to bump off good ol ' kurt so he can have her . this is beyond predictable , it doesn ' t even try to make you guess , the plot is the plot and there ' s no thinking outside the box here . i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops , but nothing is done originally or interestingly . there ' s not really anything to say about this film , it ' s not particularly bad , but there ' s no good points either . russell plays russell and you know what you ' re gonna get when you see him in a film . ditto liotta . stowe has an annoying cher - esque voice . i read the plot outline and i could see the film in my head , it was so obvious and basic . i watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as i had imagined . i felt not a drop of emotion throughout . i have no feeling towards this film , it ' s as if i never even watched it . considering this , it ' s a pretty pointless film isn ' t it ? still , i ' ll give it 3 / 10 for some reason . 
NEG i can ' t understand why so many peoples praised this show . twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my life . < br / > < br / > now i have seen all season 1 episodes , and seeing season 2 episode 1 . simply i can ' t take this show anymore . < br / > < br / > 1 ) where is the proper induction in criminal investigation ? < br / > < br / > in season 1 , there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle . can you guess why he did that ? he just want to identify murderer by doing this ' joke ' while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream . wow ! ! ! < br / > < br / > 2 ) there are too many unnecessary scenes in this show . < br / > < br / > for example , season 2 started with a ' funny ' scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor . ( he got the gun shoots in his belly already . ) this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments . that ' s all . < br / > < br / > this scene is really boring and even long ( 3 min 30 sec . . . . it ' s like hell . ) < br / > < br / > i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore . 
NEG if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film , i recommend the following : < br / > < br / > dragon : the bruce lee story < br / > < br / > rapa nui < br / > < br / > " timecop 2 : the berlin decision " is an awful film . awful production values . awful acting . awful script . i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood ( this film does neither . ) . < br / > < br / > i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing . if you are curious , perhaps a rental from netflix , but this film is definitely not for keeps . < br / > < br / > if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness , and came away disappointed , then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing . these are well - written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors : < br / > < br / > better luck tomorrow < br / > < br / > mulan 
NEG i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2 : 00 a . m . so i flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon h . b . o . where this " classic " was playing . initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning , but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie . the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females , four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle ' s diner , and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner . there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting , but certainly not worth watching . basically , if you have nothing to do some night or just can ' t sleep medication works much better . however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound , but even that can get annoying 
NEG this is an anti - serb propaganda film made for tv . < br / > < br / > " the muslims are good ; the orthodox christian serbs are bad . " < br / > < br / > that ' s the message . < br / > < br / > using " entertainment " to get across a propaganda message is nothing new . < br / > < br / > this movie lays it on thick . < br / > < br / > and apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up . < br / > < br / > i know better . < br / > < br / > the serbs , under general draza milhalovitch and his chetniks , saved over 500 shot - down us fliers from the germans in world war ii . < br / > < br / > churchill decided to betray milhalovitch and put british backing behind communist tito . roosevelt followed suit and as a result , after the war ended yugoslavia was delivered over to communist tito . < br / > < br / > and us ally milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since . < br / > < br / > this movie is part of the anti - serb propaganda campaign engineered by george soros and his international crisis group ( icg ) which culminated in the kosovo " war , " in which serbia was bombed by nato because of totally false claims by the icg of " mass graves " in kosovo filled with " victims " of the nasty serbs . the fact that there were no such mass graves and the albanians ( muslims ) had no business being in serbia ' s kosovo are facts that most of the media won ' t print . < br / > < br / > i chose this movie to watch because the one - sentence description on the video cover looked interesting . < br / > < br / > imagine my disgust when i discovered i had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at serbia . < br / > < br / > instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the clinton administration to come clean with the congress and with the american people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from iran to the muslim government in sarajevo . < br / > < br / > i won ' t hold my breath waiting for such a movie . 
NEG i saw this film a while ago on a video cd . < br / > < br / > i will 1st mention the good points . < br / > < br / > the movie , at first , at least tries to appear that it is not biased , like not showing one character as black and the other as white . both main characters are friends and co - exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing . their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport , sport rifle shooting , as comrades not as competitors . < br / > < br / > but , after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road . the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other . that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict . sure , the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english , but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began . < br / > < br / > the history , the 1990 elections , the people who caused the war are not mentioned . the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic , who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliament ' s 2nd largest party ( sdp ) . according to the constitution of bosnia , the sdp was to have the presidency in 1992 , but there was a coup in january . the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secession . < br / > < br / > the history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic , a man suspiciously absent from " stth " . he was a student of nazism in ww2 . he even wrote his own " mein kampf " in which he stated : " it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between ' the islamic religion ' and non - islamic social and political institutions " . < br / > < br / > in 1990 he lost the idap elections to " pro - yugoslavia moderate " fikret abdic , a bosnian muslim , that worked with christian serbs during the civil war , and who treated his supporters like brothers . abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic , who lost the elections but seized the seat of power . < br / > < br / > the events from above are missing from the movie , but they are the factual events that lead to the war . < br / > < br / > there were problems with props too . serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 helmets , which they did not use . also the one soldier was holding an m - 1944 ww2 rifle only used by ussr not yugoslavia . < br / > < br / > the director and script writers had a chance , but they chose to re - write history . 
NEG i ' m not usually given to hyperbole , but after seeing over two decades worth of academy awards , i can honestly say that this year ' s awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction , total cruelty , and sheer stupidity that i ' ve ever had the misfortune to witness . i ' m not talking about the awards themselves - as usual , there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won , who lost , and who never even got nominated , but the process is as it ' s always been and is as fair as it ' s liable to be . what is terribly unfair is the treatment both the " stars " and " non - stars " received at the hands of cates and horvitz , in the name of " reducing boredom . " < br / > < br / > it is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who isn ' t al pacino has been " played off " at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying , how he was saying it , and what the emotion was behind the statement . it demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect , however , to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read , to make them slink away quietly when they lose , to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium , and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience . all of those things were done to the " non - stars " - never mind that the movies wouldn ' t exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience . < br / > < br / > the stars didn ' t fare much better . it ' s becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of hilary swank and clint eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches . chris rock , as host , was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the academy had hoped , nor nearly as funny as he could be . his opening remarks were almost ( but not quite ) as offensive as sean penn made them out to be , and his comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting . of course , he could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has . in the end , chris rock was something he ' s almost never been before : a non - entity . < br / > < br / > even the musical numbers were handled poorly . beyonce sang well , but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs . another example of utter disrespect for an artist was giving jorge drexler ' s nominated song to antonio banderas - even though drexler was present and clearly wouldn ' t have minded singing his own song , based on his winning " speech . " < br / > < br / > the efforts of cates and horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree , but what resulted was a show devoid of life . we ' ve all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don ' t know , about the overblown production , about the self - congratulatory quality . but this is their night - not ours . what is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated . cates and horvitz should , frankly , be ashamed . 
NEG if you ' ve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says , " jesus is the answer . what ' s the question ? " , then perhaps you should thank god if you ' ve never met a lacanian . slavoj zizek , the most evangelical of lacanians , would surely exchange the word " jesus " in that statement for " lacan / hegel " . < br / > < br / > zizek ' s star burns brightly at the moment , no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption . so it seems impressive when someone - anyone - comes along and says , " hang on , films may say something about ourselves . " < br / > < br / > the ideas zizek expounds in this film are " true " purely because he says so . for example , zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego , superego and id ( god knows what happened to zeppo , or gummo perhaps they ' re the sinthome . . . or is that movies themselves ? ) . this is simply what they are . in zizek ' s output , culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology . people may object that he certainly has something to say - but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god ' s will ? < br / > < br / > what ' s wrong with taking examples , from films or anywhere , to illustrate theory ? well , nothing at all . as zizek seems to believe , they may even serve as a proof . however , it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context . without context , you can say and prove anything you want . for zizek , lacan is the answer  so he goes and makes an example of it . everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out , to serve this ideology . for instance , zizek ' s exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop . but , in the context of the film , this is not a voyeur ' s fantasy position at all . stewart has been deliberately led there by novak . this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek ' s two hour and a half cinematic sermon . < br / > < br / > his analysis of the " baby wants to f - - - " scene in blue velvet is laughable . touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific ( to the masculine ) truth of " feminine jouissance " , zizek says that isabella rossilini ' s character not only demands her degradation but is , unconsciously , in charge of the situation . this is an example of her " jouissance " . well . . . possibly . but - sorry to be prosaic - where is the evidence for this ? in the film , she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son . zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan . but this may be due to any number of things . isn ' t that the point of so - called feminine " jouissance " ? according to lacan , feminine jouissance , unlike phallic jouissance , cannot be articulated , it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language . if this is right , then no example can be made of it . it also means that the entire concept is non - sensical and entirely mystical . it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek : " there ' s feminine jouissance for you ! why is this feminine jouissance ? because i say so . " < br / > < br / > what example can really be garnered from these films ? only zizek ' s psychology . why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films , even to the point that , when in a boat on botega bay , he says he wants to f - - - rod steiger too ? is this not the wish - fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films ? as the saying goes , freud would have a field day with the pervert ' s guide to the cinema - but with zizek himself , nobody else . < br / > < br / > zizek ' s theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it , but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws . this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely - as to be almost useless - how the rest of us desire . for , as any psychoanalyst knows , how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated - and cannot be easily universalised , if at all . zizek ' s love of making everything an example of lacan ' s answer bears this out : how do we desire ? like this , this is how i do it . problem is , in zizek ' s desire , everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire . but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don ' t like letting the " subject " speak for itself . < br / > < br / > the pervert ' s guide to the cinema is a summation zizek ' s love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political ( what dogma isn ' t ? ) . zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis , what he is trying to discover , because the terms of his exploration , and therefore his ethics in doing so , are never put into question . < br / > < br / > zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing . he ' s a kind of henry ford of cultural theory : mass - production and any colour as long as it ' s black . he is perfect for today ' s highly consumerist society : supposedly critical while giving people the same c - ap over and over and pretending that it is something different . this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems - which capitalism always claims to provide - rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all . which is kind of like being brain dead . for me , zizek ' s third matrix pill is a suicide capsule . < br / > < br / > ps : i loved zizek ' s solemn remark - presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity - that music in films can greatly affect people ' s sympathies . did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws ? 
NEG i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged . the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform . her humour is also to be appreciated . she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage . however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism . can ' t say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system . appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed . all said apart from ariauna ' s performance it is indeed utter trash . 
NEG ok the plot is , wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes , strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies ( sometimes a combination of the two ) then a demon comes around kills the men , rapes and kills the women , and waxes poetic about the meaning of life . moronic special effects , bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside , you get what you expect from a film with a title like this . i guess it would have to be someone ' s cup of tea , just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo ' gaira ' komizu directed film . < br / > < br / > dvd extras : subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part 1 ( part 2 is on the entrails of a beautiful woman dvd ) ; and theatrical tailer < br / > < br / > my grade : f 
NEG plot : an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra - marital hijinks in a flashy car . they then become stuck ( literally ) in a compromising position , while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities . < br / > < br / > that ' s it . that ' s the entire movie . there may have been some dialogue here and there , but nothing comes to mind . it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless , but actually physically painful to watch . the fact that it starred two of the uks best up - and - coming actors ( one of whom is now sadly deceased ) only adds to the horror . < br / > < br / > ian charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar - winning ' chariots of fire ' . let ' s remember him for that role , and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened . 
NEG just a stilted rip - off of the infinitely better " murder , she wrote " , it is absolutely amazing that this poorly - written garbage lasted for a full eight years . i ' m sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do , or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show . van dyke , who only had a decent career in the 1960s , never was much of an actor at all ( by his own admission ) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 . he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking . his talentless real life son barry , a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn ' t involve his father , plays his son in the series . 
NEG a less - than - subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show . throughout the show , dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked , especially " if god is so good , why does he allow evil to exist in the world ? " < br / > < br / > diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version ( though some might disagree ) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the " company line " and condemns half the world to burn in hell . to celebrate her school ' s 25th anniversary , she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant . < br / > < br / > however , when the quartet " update " their play to parody sister mary ' s " fallacious " teachings , the nun is pushed over the edge , sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events . the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts . < br / > < br / > not recommended . go watch the play instead . 
NEG another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930 ' s , resurrected by the magic of dvd . < br / > < br / > starring stock universal player lionel atwill ( often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies ) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket . one kills the victims ( stockbrokers involved in a scam ) and asks witnesses for the exact time , while the other is deaf and is proved " innocent " because he could not have spoken to witnesses . < br / > < br / > of course , where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness , wouldn ' t they both be deaf ? oh , well . < br / > < br / > atwill does a pretty good job here , faking being deaf and mute . unfortunately , no one else here can really act worth a darn . 
NEG < br / > < br / > i watched this movie just a little while ago and i found that this movie was terrible ! it moved very slowly and was hardly entertaining ! < br / > < br / > sorry for all those that liked it . . . . this is only my opinion ! 
NEG i really wanted to like this movie a lot more than i did . that ' s because i love wacky foreign comedies - - particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise . however , although this one frequently caught me by surprise , these were almost never pleasant surprises . it reminded me of south park in that nearly every social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny . for example , after exploring adultery , drug abuse ( of nearly every sort - - ranging from pot , heroin , speed to glue sniffing ) , prostitution , s & m , suicide , murder , etc . , the movie got to the hilarious ( ? ) topic of pedophilia . mom encouraged her one son ( who looked about 12 years - old ) to sleep with neighboring men . in fact , at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work ! funny ? ! you ' ve got to be kidding . this movie just goes too far and delves into the " black hole of comedy " . what should they make fun of next , cancer or rectal tumors ? 
NEG i don ' t ' know . . . maybe it ' s because i ' m brazilian but all that stuff was too much . too much love for the music , too much parties , too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters ( come on , it ' s not so sad ) and the aspect of the city shown by the director . everything looks too fake to me : the families , the relationships , the music , the " happiness " . it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture . i must be honest : it did seduce me a little , but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music , sex and parties ? i ' m not that stupid : what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea , profound sadness and stds ? i liked the scene with caridad ' s mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people . 
NEG what the hell was all that about ? i saw the matrix and was amazed . it was the most spectacular movie ever made . what ever possesed the wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me . < br / > < br / > there is no plot , you can ' t argue with that . basically all this film was was a load of talking , and don ' t get me wrong , i have no problem with talky films , but all the talking in the matrix reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle . then there would be a fight sequence which lasted way too long , then more pointless drivvle , then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti - climax ever . a little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes . < br / > < br / > also , keanu reeves gives his worst performance yet . i knew he wasn ' t a good actor but this was beyond a joke . if you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along . god knows what his performance is like in something ' s gotta give ! keanu reeves : the only plank of wood ever to become an actor . < br / > < br / > after the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment . if you haven ' t already seen the first film i suggest you watch it , but don ' t waste your time with this utter pile of turd . < br / > < br / > 
NEG spoilers of both this and the matrix follow . < br / > < br / > i liked the original matrix a great deal . it was not a deep movie , despite fishburne ' s attempts to philosophize , but it was fairly well paced , fun , and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights . < br / > < br / > in the original , neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson . by day , corporate drone , and by night , brave hacker . eventually , he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine , or does he go back to the safe , forgettable world he started in . interestingly , he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions , life rather sucks . he has his girl by his side and his boon companions , but he eats processed swill , dresses in sweats , and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery . still , the truth makes him free . < br / > < br / > at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the " what if it were me " questions raised in the viewer ' s mind . what if _i_ were capable of the impossible ? what if i were " the one " . it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of , with a cool title like that . < br / > < br / > further , agent smith made a wonderful bad guy , as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us . he was as unstoppable as a terminator , and as merciless . < br / > < br / > at the end of the matrix , neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom . < br / > < br / > this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie , and it does so with such lack of gusto , such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes . when the dialog is at a fifth grade level , with various long words dropped in randomly , i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying . < br / > < br / > my short list of characterization failures : < br / > < br / > the oracle goes from mildly helpful , if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason . < br / > < br / > major " personalities " of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster , for example , was a cute idea , but just not that interesting a character . < br / > < br / > fishburne loses his " advisor " role , and gets nothing to replace it with . < br / > < br / > the people of zion are not particularly likable , nor would you really _want_ them running the world . < br / > < br / > special effects problems : < br / > < br / > the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable . in the matrix , you felt neo could lose , and that he had to become something greater in order to survive . in the matrix reloaded , he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game . < br / > < br / > the fight on the freeway looked quite fake , and not that interesting . < br / > < br / > pacing problems . < br / > < br / > as i mentioned above , the fight scenes were interminable . < br / > < br / > the rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch . not because we mind good dancing and good orgies , but because we did not know about the people pictured , nor did we care . < br / > < br / > whatever hack wrote the creator ' s soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business . it meandered , used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand , and was a waste of time and a pacing killer . the creator ' s speech could have been done in a tenth the time , and with more peril as " zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix . there are now too many people who do not believe ; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it . further , the earth cannot support even the people in zion , let alone these others . you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion , while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix . " < br / > < br / > instead , we got a long , drawn out bunch of twaddle . if someone argues that it is deep , ask for a transcript , and try breaking down the sentences . each one is too long by several clauses , and uses words with clearer , shorter synonyms . < br / > < br / > so , in summary , not worth seeing . < br / > < br / > i have seen the third one , and despite what a number of reviewers have said , skip it . it does not save this turkey . < br / > < br / > the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were " deep " should go see some truly deep movies . perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate , and perhaps a bit of philosophy . this movie is just not hard to understand , but it is hard to stomach . < br / > < br / > scott 
NEG this film has nothing whatever to do with the sphinx , and the title is just a come - on . the story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the valley of the kings , of king seti i , second pharaoh of the 19th dynasty , new kingdom period . it is not a bad yarn , and a great deal of the film is shot on location . even the scenes in the winter palace hotel lobby in luxor were really shot there , and not in a studio . the second unit stuff is endless , and they must have been let loose on egypt for weeks . frank langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated egyptian . he should take it up as a sideline . the film is essentially ruined by one of the world ' s most irritating actresses , lesley anne down , who plays the lead . she spends the whole film wondering how she looks , are her blue eyes refracting light at the correct angle , do all the fellas lust after her , etc . having started life as a model at the age of ten , what hope could there be for her ? she epitomises everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dim - witted inanity . and to think that this film was directed by franklin shaffner , who won an oscar for ' patton ' ! he allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film , hysterical one moment , flirting the next , in a kind of hurricane of idiocy as she reels from one man to another , either screaming or making bedroom eyes , it matters not . she is supposed to be a young egyptologist . but she has never been to egypt before ! she takes a taxi to giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids , gushes in ecstasy : ' but they ' re so big ! ! ! ! ' barf ! ok , so that was the script , but she takes to the banality too readily , giving the impression that it is her natural element , which i don ' t doubt for a minute . elements of the story are sound . there is , indeed , a serious problem about a black market in antiquities there . true ! well done ! the novel by robin cook , which i have not seen , may be ok for all i know . it was fun to see the name of cyril swern as sound recordist on the film , as i knew him pretty well long ago . stanley kubrick ' s step - daughter katharina is described as ' draughtswoman ' . i wonder what that means ? maybe she did some set work . anyway , the antiquities in the film are pretty good , actually . and we get to see lots of the cairo museum and numerous scenic locations . they actually go inside king tutankhamun ' s tomb ! i don ' t imagine that would be allowed today for a movie . a lot of inappropriate scenes take place in mosques . that would not go down well today , but in 1981 such things were not on the agenda . the music for the film is absolutely appalling , worse than lesley anne down in fact ! but there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic , one being the cacophony of traffic noise of cairo , which is accurately rendered in the background , and would make anyone who knows cairo chuckle nervously . also , the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time , another touch of authenticity . why didn ' t they get this right ? it could have been good . 
NEG i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of " spiritual " new age types , who , quite unlike me , very much enjoyed this movie - - - although according to those that also knew the book ( apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense ) , the movie is not quite as good . so , if you tend to think of yourself as " spiritual " , believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like " aura " and " astral body " , and don ' t mind the frequent use of the term " energy " outside of the context of physics or technology , you might actually like the movie , and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on . < br / > < br / > however , if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe , if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based thereon , if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality , and perhaps even expect reasonable non - wooden dialog an acting , then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie : stay . away . < br / > < br / > don ' t even think about it . tonight , this movie displaced dungeons and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater ( i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad , such as plan 9 etc . ) . at the same time , it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two ( d & d being the other one ) . i do not walk out on movies , not even on this one , but i should ' ve when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura , because the new age bs keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on . < br / > < br / > the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies , in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution . or something like that . they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution , which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe . the movie is shock full with whoppers like that . occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as " another dimension " , or perhaps " another plane " , only to become invisible to those around them who haven ' t yet reached enlightenment . goodness . < br / > < br / > at the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the " insights " making up the prophecy , painfully slow , presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better , more enlightened individuals . < br / > < br / > good things about the movie ? some very pretty nature shots , and some decent supporting performances by elizondo and de almeida . < br / > < br / > i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable . it really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind , and unless that ' s your thing , you better do something else with your time and money . 
NEG i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie . be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book . many of the book ' s most interesting points do not even come out in the movie . it is a " b " movie at best . many events , characters , how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur . the flow of events that in the book are very smooth , are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child . the character development is very poor . personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book . the direction is similar to a " b " horror flick . i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book , but they screen play base missed many points . the casting was very good . 
NEG this film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers . the main point of the book , the insights , are hardly even touched upon , leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives . < br / > < br / > the character development is not good at all . no background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them , and so the action sequences fall flat . < br / > < br / > the search for the manuscripts ends abruptly , and with no real explanation , not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for . < br / > < br / > this is one of the worst adaptations of a book i have ever seen . it is horrible and a waste of time . if you have not read the book , skip the movie and read it . if you have read the book , skip the movie and reread it . < br / > < br / > it is almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book , that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is . it is a shame too , because it could have been good had they capitalized on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors . < br / > < br / > please don ' t waste your time , read the book ! ! ! 
NEG misty ayers had a smoking body , and that ' s all this movie was about . pure exploitation flick . i started playing a game with myself , counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music . and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes . case in point : casually walking into a room and saying " hello " was scored with chase music from a roman epic . i ' d like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released . what i learned from this movie : that women ' s low - rise panties existed in 1954 . i ' m talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties . at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing ( except for bra and panties , sadly ) . also includes horrendous dubbing , leading to a " look out ! godzirra ! " effect . 
NEG hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest , though the audience sees he is a werewolf . the hunters never seem to realize this , because after they shoot him , he looks normal when they decapitate him . < br / > < br / > a doctor transplants the werewolf ' s eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment . the man , rich , gets to have sex with his nurse ( stephanie beaton ) before he even gets his bandages removed . < br / > < br / > after he leaves the hospital , he finds his wife has been cheating on him too . when a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon ( with a fake tree branch on the foreground ) , he turns into a werewolf ! his torso grows larger , splitting his shirt , and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes . his pants stay intact . the mouth chews unconvincingly , though some sort of robotics ( or hidden hands ) in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times . < br / > < br / > despite the poor werewolf costume , there is a fair amount of blood and gore , and those are fairly well done . there ' s even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie . however , when a man falls from a height , a rather bad dummy does the job . < br / > < br / > rich has a friend named siodmak who is some sort of occult expert , and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named androse who is also such an expert . they try to help him a little . < br / > < br / > rich kills people who have done him wrong . a policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on beaton , who doesn ' t much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it . < br / > < br / > quite cheap , but between the nudity and blood and gore , and a not - terrible story combining ( sort of ) the most dangerous game with the hands of orlac and the wolf man , it ' s somewhat entertaining . available on its own , or in the box set scream queens vol . 1 . 
NEG when i was at the movie store the other day , i passed up blonde and blonder , but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie . who knows ? i mean , i ' m sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it , blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up . but when i started watching it : executive producer pamela anderson , wow , i knew i was in for something scary . not only that , but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness : pam anderson and denise richards , not to offend them , but they were not aging well at all and they ' re playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20 ' s , not their 40 ' s . the story was just plain bad and obnoxious . < br / > < br / > dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde ' s , they really don ' t have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world , it ' s just really sad . but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins , the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their " ignorance is bliss " attitudes . they are set up to make a " hit " on a guy , and they think they ' re just going to " show him a good time " , but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls . < br / > < br / > denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before . i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy , but it was more than stupid , it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary . would i ever recommend this ? not in a million years , the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as " sex kittens " , it ' s more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell . < br / > < br / > 1 / 10 
NEG this movie is a waste of film stock . do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see ? it happened in this film . do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a " negro " unit . . . cooking , supply services , burial detail , etc . ? it happened in this film . do you believe that a black ( and supposedly intelligent ) officer would select this same deaf k . p . to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived ? it happened in this film . would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn ' t realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him ? it happened in this film . would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold - up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50 ' away ? they did it in this film , and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected . would you believe that , over the airwaves and in clear english , the captain mentioned the general ' s rank , if not his name , as the person he was speaking with and that the general , in plain english over open airwaves , said that the dam had to be protected the next day ? maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans . this so - called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films . if it were , i ' m sure it would do well . watch it at your own risk . 
NEG i understand there was some conflict between leigh and the great maggie smith during the filming . understandable when you put one of the world ' s greatest actresses of all time ( smith , of course ) with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent film . 
NEG what a load of leftist hollywood bilge . this movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles . the fairytale ends with the pacifist character , played by danzel washington , actually getting promoted for his treason . what is it with these hollywood tools ? is this still payback for mccarthyism ? < br / > < br / > if i sound cynical it ' s because i am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda . the military brass in this movie are portrayed as , what else ? gung - ho war mongers . sound familiar ? ever see a movie where the cia or any government agency is not evil ? think about it . yet again , crimson tide stresses the point . the hackman character , u - boat captain ramsey , comes across like a raving lunatic , until the very end when , of course he comes to his senses , does a complete 360 , renounces his blood lust , suggests a promotion for the treasonous ron hunter , and repents by retiring from the service . a guy mutinies , takes command of your boat , puts the u . s at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first - strike , and you promote him ? ? ? ? what hogwash ! 
NEG i really hate this show ! i had watched one episode , and i knew this show is really terrible . the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad . . . i mean it is just a sh + + ty rip - off of dexter ' s laboratory and johnny quest , ' bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog ; a stay - at - home dad and a smart , super - busy mom . . . like oh - my - flippin ' - god ! their dad is a mother - f * * kin ' crazy home - maker , isn ' t that so gay ! if my dad is a home - maker , i would personally die ! of shame that is . . . really i would . < br / > < br / > i have nothing else to about this . . . this travesty but only 3 word ; count them 3 words to describe it : < br / > < br / > · lame , · stupid , and above all . . . · f * * k up ! that ' s all i could say folks , it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev - er ! if i had one that is . 
NEG the only thing i remember about this movie are two things : first , as a twelve year old , even i thought it stunk . second , it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it , they quit after the first page , and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it . < br / > < br / > if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period , try animal house . it ' s so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art . another good selection would be caddyshack , the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming , with great lines like greens keeper carl spackler ' s " correct me if i ' m wrong sandy , but if i kill all the golfers they ' ll lock me up and throw away the key . " 
NEG i wanted to like this film , yes its a saw , blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films . if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good , not brilliant , but good film . . . . unfortunately those ingredients had gone off ! the acting was terrible , and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one ( hoods taken off ) , the remarks and one liners are just terrible , yes i know , bad writing . . . . but this is more than that , it was bad writing coupled with bad acting . two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film . . . . . < br / > < br / > sorry , im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all . < br / > < br / > i will end with plot holes , plot holes & more plot holes ! disappointing ! 
NEG i do not watch much television and came across this show . reality show ? i sure hope this is not for real . if i was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty , it would be grounds for divorce . i think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love . that is one thing that is wrong with our world now , so many people in bad relationships , selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another . it is self sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt . that does not give one a very good feeling , to watch what should be in private counseling . if his personality on the show is for real , then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is . is this show a reality or made up for ratings ? ? ? ? i really would like to know . sincerely , gb 
NEG for starters and for the record , the term " necromancy " describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does not , in any way , relate to having sex with cadavers . that is called necrophilia and , yes , i know it ' s an obvious difference but i ' m already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that i sport a perverted taste in movies ! this movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy , in fact , and merely just qualifies as boring , inept and terribly bad . " necromancy " makes at least one top five ranking , namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made ! now , director bert i . gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces ( on his repertoire there are titles like " earth vs . the spider " , " king dinosaur " and " food of the gods " ) but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless , redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns . shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead , lori and her husband frank move to the quiet little town of lillith , where frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory . lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity , especially with the town ' s patriarch and " owner " mr . cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious . that ' s another thing . how can anybody " own " a town and everybody in it ? either way , lori gradually discovers that everybody in lillith is a witch and mr . cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead . since many years already , cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he ' s prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes . i honestly don ' t see the point of the whole movie . it ' s a blatant rip - off of " rosemary ' s baby "  one of the alternate titles even is " rosemary ' s disciples "  but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief . why isn ' t anyone allowed to have children for as long as cato ' s son remains dead ? that ' s just really selfish ! when , where and how did lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead ? " necromancy " definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments , but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget . the grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy . orson welles ' performance  undoubtedly the low point of his career  is pitiable , and still it ' s the best aspect about the entire movie . 
NEG this is a typical low budget 1970 ' s mess . it ' s supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting bigfoot through the pacific northwest . every character is a stereotype , from the native american to the cynical cowboy . the acting and narration are a complete joke . if you ' re hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage - keep hoping . there won ' t be much , and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder ; it would look better than this movie . < br / > < br / > it ' s not that i don ' t like 1970 ' s low budge fare ; i do . it ' s that this is such a mess of bad acting , bad characters , lousy story and no thrills that you just can ' t enjoy it . it does not fit into the " so bad it ' s good " category , nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances . it ' s mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping , hiking , riding horses , and watching wild life . there is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid ; supposedly our friend sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him . by that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker ' s heads and stop the whole thing . 
NEG lame plot and two - dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut - outs . needless to say , this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters , especially the fiancé ; he looked and acted more like a cartoon . in summary , i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama . it uses just about every cliché in the book . the tortured classical musician who wants to break - out and play salsa . the free - spirited fiancée engaged to a " bean counter " personality she doesn ' t love . i won ' t list them or else it would be a spoiler because i ' d be giving away the whole plot . the dancing was ok but nothing special . i ' ve seen worse . 3 stars for good music . the band was really tight . i saw it on youtube . thankfully i didn ' t pay good money to see it at a theater . i ' m still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished . 
NEG really ? really ? ? ? ? i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage . horrible in every sense . terribly inaccurate in so many ways . i have an easier time believing the president of the united states suiting up , flying a jet fighter , and shooting down aliens . it is easier to note the few things that were right . my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years . it was overacted , seemingly pointless plot diversions , and had questionable cinematography at times . < br / > < br / > x - box , youtube , acupat utilities did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004 ? it ' s not like you had to do extensive research , it was only five years before this movie came out . i am an iraq war veteran and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or an eod squad you would realize how b . s . this movie is . to compare this to platoon or saving private ryan is ludicrous . why don ' t you just throw commando and red dawn in there too ; i think those might be more accurate . < br / > < br / > if for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot , the historical and factual discrepancies , then this movie might just be ok . nothing more . if you keep on hearing " oscar buzz " , and have to add your own pompous review , go right ahead . as for me , i am writing the director to see if i can get my 131 minutes back . 
NEG well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today . what a major disappointment ! 1 ) if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u . s . military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are . they mirrored my own thoughts ; as the movie played i - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself , " say what ? there ' s no way that would happen like that . . " 2 ) there ' s very little that actually happens in terms of plot . a new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed ( a death that isn ' t really clearly explained ) . the new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work . his attitude puts others at risk . that ' s it ! 3 ) this movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed . if you want suspense try one of the bourne movies . if you want to see a war movie that ' s emotionally powerful , try renting go tell the spartans , which is about the vietnam war , and stars burt lancaster ( who told me personally in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work , and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over - hyped apocalypse now ) , or an old wwii black and white classic sink the bismark , which , especially for an english film , is unbelievably heart - wrenching . don ' t waste your time on hurt locker . 
NEG there are some bad movies out there . most of them are rather fun . " criminally insane 1 " was one of those flicks . so bad that it was enjoyable and had re - watch value to it . " criminally insane 2 " has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me , that ' s saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst . but trust me , this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long . < br / > < br / > the movie has a rather incoherent storyline , but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn ' t being fed . well , you don ' t see that in this movie , except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one . the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there , but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep . < br / > < br / > the camera work in this movie is just atrocious . this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15 . the sound quality is something else as you can ' t understand a word most of the characters are saying . to give an example of how bad it is , go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers , that is what this movie sounds like . not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood . < br / > < br / > now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can ' t describe just how bad this movie is . if you don ' t believe me , see it for yourself . 1 / 10 
NEG during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii , i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover . unfortunately , it was . the story itself is mindlessly simple . ethel , a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder , is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding . she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another ' s soup . ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food . ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then . . . . well , you get the idea . if this all sounds like fun , it isn ' t . this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting . the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store . to make matters worse , half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first ethel movie , criminally insane , which is little better . a very poor effort . 
NEG after harry reems ' teenage girlfriend is raped by zebbedy colt ( the night - walker ) , reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians . meanwhile , colt , who carries a cane and dresses like a magician , rapes some more women . eventually , reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree . despite being shot on film and marginally nasty , it looks like any other 70 ' s porno and is ineptly executed . the rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on " death wish " is laughable . r . bolla ( " cannibal holocaust " ) plays a cop . colt , who is usually over - the - top , wigs out in a couple of scenes , but he ' s too well behaved for my money . this roughie could have been much rougher . 
NEG the word " 1st " in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims . at least they don ' t have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise . < br / > < br / > 1st should refer to : 1st draft of a script ; 1st takes used in each performance in the final film ; 1st edit in post production ; etcetera , etcetera . < br / > < br / > the movie is not cast too badly , it ' s just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate , from the goofy script , to the wooden performances . and while suffering through this cobbled together film , by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery . at 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours . < br / > < br / > going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes . even in the equally awful , lake placid , at least the performances bill pullman and bridget fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script , were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie . in 1st to die , one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead ' s suicide . < br / > < br / > the editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters , who i think ( were never quite told ) is a d . a . she just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation . obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor ' s floor . and no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy . < br / > < br / > in a word , don ' t waste your time with this one . my wife and i wish we didn ' t . but at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was mystery science theater . " meanwhile , in cleveland . . . . " ! ! ! ! 
NEG i saw this movie for 2 reasons - - i like gerard butler and christopher plummer . unfortunately , these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie . i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of judas iscariot , because it does explain his disdain for all things christian , but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been . i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public ( me and the 5 other people who saw this film ) that he still exists . i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself . 
NEG i wasted my time and gave this show a chance . this has to be one of the worst new shows . if they gave an award to shows that suck this one should sweep the category . the acting is poor and the story line is contrived . now dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining . that show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped . this new show , based on an insurance companies commercials , is not funny and really has nothing going for it . possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were , and still are , repeated is what is wrong with this show . it just came to tv and already we are tired of seeing the " caveman " characters . 
NEG i have watched 3 episodes of caveman , and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better . < br / > < br / > to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials , with no real humor . as we sat around watching these shows , we all speculated on what was going to happen . < br / > < br / > the episode of the woman cave - woman with a attitude was actually a big , yea right , for us . she ' s crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers , and truth be told , she needed a slap < br / > < br / > i consider myself a pretty good reviewer , taking in everything , but i must say , cavemen is comparable to the old show , my mother , the car . i give it a 2 , only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it . 
NEG so why does this show suck ? unfortunately , that really is the only question , because there is no doubt that it does . < br / > < br / > for those unfamiliar with the premise of the show , the doomed - to - be - shortlived series cavemen focuses on a number of neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day america and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for geico insurance . the concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully . < br / > < br / > i had to think about it for awhile , but then the tagline from the commercials - - something to the effect of " we ' re not that much different from you " provided me with the key to the show ' s suckiness . even though cavemen / neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity , the title characters of this show , it turns out , are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks . < br / > < br / > maybe its my background as a game writer - - rather than a soulless , hack , committee - based writer from california - - but this show had so much potential , and none of it has been realized . to start with , the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us . < br / > < br / > what could conceivably be funny , for example , about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk , when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks ? why would they play prosaic games like squash , when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears ? a show like this could write itself , and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring . < br / > < br / > another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities . yawn ! this has been done so many times before , and never more drearily than this . and , as noted previously , neanderthals really are a different species , so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark . < br / > < br / > responses are welcome , including those from anyone who wants to tell me why i ' m wrong . i ' d like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that i have thus far been unable to . < br / > < br / > michael j . varhola , skirmisher online gaming magazine 
NEG i ' ve always been enthusiastic about period dramas , an art form in which the bbc has excelled in the past . this presentation of " byron " was unbelievable . unbelievably bad ! the script was dreadful , the acting uninspired , and all the characters woefully insipid . apparently byron was " mad bad and dangerous to know " , and set the ladies hearts all - a - flutter . not in this production . here he appeared as a tawdry jumped - up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence . it is said that byron walked with a limp . this portrayal of the man was just limp all over . < br / > < br / > i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life . not a splutter , not even a glimmer . it was utter tedium , if not downright boredom , from start to finish . < br / > < br / > having the opinion that no - one will ever better the bard of avon , i also believe that byron ' s poetry is over - revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner , and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment . < br / > < br / > i think the bbc lost its nous with this one 
NEG scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately ( such as minotaur or dog soldiers ) . grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf , however , it deviates so much ( and offers so little in comparison ) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it ' some shitty christopher lambert movie ' . i wasn ' t expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production , but i did however expect the ' artistic integrity ' to not interfere with the actual story ( even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots ) . < br / > < br / > did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing ( did any research go into this ? ) . obviously not , as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that beowulf and his crew ( save for mullet boy ) are wearing . one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendel if beowulf is supposed to wrestle him , shouldn ' t he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons ? grendel ' s death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script ; for example : grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by beowulf  not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs ! and grendel ' s mother did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds ? and honestly , what the hell was with that mullet ? < br / > < br / > if you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic . don ' t , as there really isn ' t one ( other than character names ) . the only way i could recommend this film is if you liked the movie druids ( directed by jacques dorfmann )  although i don ' t recommend watching either . 
NEG this is a made - for - tv and rather needless sci - fi channel retelling of the beowulf story , especially after the recent 2005 film " beowulf and grendel " . this movie doesn ' t really get into beowulf ' s story , but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior , beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster ' s rampage . if this is successfully accomplished , the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay . after a few failed attempts , the creature is slain , but it ' s angry and vengeful mother soon attacks , leaving it up to beowulf to , again , lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it . " grendel " looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the cg effects are terrible . like i said , this movie is absolutely needless . 
NEG just once i ' d like to see a version of beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem . yet again , after watching this sci fi presentation , i ' m disappointed . < br / > < br / > i ' m not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in old english , but i wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern english and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires . the story is exciting enough ; why add plot elements that are non - existent and ruin the story ? what ' s wrong with being faithful to the text ? < br / > < br / > grendel is immune to weapons of any kind ; why introduce some super - crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period ( as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer ) ? the fight with grendel was beowulf vs . grendel . that ' s it . no one else took part in the battle . the only way beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons , the mistake made by all previous challengers . yet , in this version , danes and geats fight the beast and beowulf hacks off grendel ' s arm with a sword ! again , why couldn ' t they portray what really happened ? personally , i think a one - on - one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting . < br / > < br / > overall , this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale . why add in a pact with hrothgar and grendel ' s mother that includes sacrificial offering ? why create extra characters , like finn , that add nothing to the story ? there was no love story in the poem . they couldn ' t even set the scenes in the appropriate locations ( a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake ) . they fail to notice the metaphor that grendel ' s lair signifies  it ' s supposed to be underground to represent hell . why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem ? even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on beowulf , since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story . if hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot , then that would be a truly great movie . 
NEG i ' m ask . . . what a f * * * are whit the real - tv never i see some b * * * * * * * in my life is : a * * * * * * , dirty , f * * * * * * bad and other a * * * * * * * things but anything more is just a piece of american s * * * all time britney saying ' ' oh s * * * , i wanna see his cock , i wanna f * * * , and stuck his d * * * ' ' and he thinking ' ' oh like i gone to still her money ' ' it ' s just another show of s * * * any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it ' s just like i say another s * * * show in this s * * * sill out the money pure sex all f * * * * * * * time , i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f * * * * * * money 
NEG i ' m embarrassed to be writing this review . i say that because those of you reading it will know that i sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers . but i just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on imdb before they watch a film not to watch this one . it ' s the least i can do . this is a bad movie ! trust me . the plot is goofy . the acting is amateurish . and the directing , camera work , sets , costumes , etc . are all second rate . let it go . 
NEG wow it ' s ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago . < br / > < br / > anyways , i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl , for the record . < br / > < br / > the movie was ridiculous . the characters drove me insane , they were so cliché and stereotyped . this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard . it had way too many plot twists too . < br / > < br / > there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however , the scene : " warm heart , cold gun " where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower . ( well , actually they were all obnoxious . ) but his acting in that scene was excellent . the look on his face , it reminded my of american psycho ( a good movie ) . the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for , do yourself a favor and don ' t watch it . 
NEG a cheesy , compellingly awful ( and not in a fun way ) c grade movie . everything shouts ' amateur ' , from the crumby script ( bizarre premises , limited coherence and predictable endings ; the turgid lighting , sound and hand - held wobbly camera angles ; the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references ; the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting . i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out . all is forgiven - your worst films are works of art , and more coherent than this twaddle . < br / > < br / > but still , preferable to the warbling ' every night in my dreams i hear you ' - are you sure the titanic crew weren ' t involved in this on the side ? 
NEG we now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine . it ' s the world of godzilla , rodan , mothra ghidrah and their kind - a strange world , and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called gamera . < br / > < br / > forever in the shadow of the monolithic toho studios , second rung daiei studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies . in the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to toho ' s mammothly successful godzilla . they wisely chose gamera as their flagship - a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggle - teeth , and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shell ' s feet - holes ( and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire ! ) . < br / > < br / > the first gamera film " gamera the invincible " ( as it was sold to the us ) is a virtual mirror of the first godzilla film , only 10 years behind . american fighters chase an unmarked plane over the arctic to its fiery demise - the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant gamera from its icy slumber . feeding off atomic energy , it immediately goes on a rampage , and the world wants to destroy gamera once and for all , but a little japanese boy named kenny , who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside , believes gamera is essentially kind and benevolent . he ' s like a little jewish kid with a pinup of hitler . " gamera is a good turtle , " he pleads , then sulks , and puts on a face like someone ' s pooped in his coco pops . miraculously the world ' s leaders listen to him , and so begins z - plan to save the world and gamera from complete destruction . < br / > < br / > released in 1965 , gamera was a surprising hit . the annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both japan and the us , and the sight of gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of tokyo and the north pole is gloriously chintzy . most surprising of all is the longevity of the series : eight original gamera films , plus a slew of recent remakes . not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast - and if i hear " gamera is friends to all children " one more time i ' m going to crush tokyo . which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a seiko billboard in the 1965 turtle - fest gamera . 
NEG what ' s that there in the skies ? is it a plane ? is it superman ? ? errr , no it ' s a turtle ! ? ! see , that ' s what becomes of the cold war ! nothing but bad news and other issues ! the americans shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts & literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle - creature named gammera . he / she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path . the arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super - sophisticated ice - bomb , but gammera has another surprise in store the damn turtle can fly ! the first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence ! gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air . how can you not love that ? then there ' s also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who ' s able to telepathically communicate with the monster , but that ' s just not interesting enough . flying turtle , people ! ! there ' s very little else to write about this japanese ( and american re - edited ) sci - fi effort , apart from that it ' s an obvious and totally shameless rip - off of such classics like the original godzilla and the beast from 20 . 000 fathoms . the effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and , unlike the aforementioned films , it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance . respectable actors like brian donlevy ( " the quatermass experiment " ) and dick o ' neill ( " wolfen " ) seem unaware of what film set they ' re on and even the original japanese mayhem - scenes aren ' t very convincing . gammera ' s very own and personalized theme - song is rather cool , though , so it gets one extra point for that . 
NEG melissa ' s sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she ' s just discovering her sexuality with boys . but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic ' 80 ' s slasher film . it ' s up to the local town sheriff dan burke ( bo hopkins , the wild bunch ) and his annoying mystery - loving goody two - shoes daughter , marci ( dana kimmell , friday the 13th part 3 ) , to get to the bottom of these killings . < br / > < br / > this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it ' s ' 80 ' s slasher brethren . it doesn ' t hurt that alesia has a great body ( i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i ' m not overly perverted ) . on the downside , the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary , a grating theme some that is used a bit too often , and an ending that is a tad anti - climatic . but the good outweigh the bad ( barely ) . give this a rent , but i wouldn ' t buy it . < br / > < br / > eye candy : aleisa shirley shows her tits , bush and ass < br / > < br / > my grade : c < br / > < br / > code red dvd extras : an intro by star aleisa shirley and director of intruder , scott spiegel ; both director ' s cut & theatrical version of the film ; audio conversation with star shirley and director jim sotos ; interview with shirley , sotos & bo hopkins ; still gallery ; theatrical trailer for this film ; and trailers for nightmare , stunt rock , rituals , & balalaika conspiracy 
NEG rex reed once said of a movie ( " julia and julia " to be specific ) that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice . i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly . this one appeared to be shot through gauze . < br / > < br / > the story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors ' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time . < br / > < br / > also , everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters . i call this the " dead poets society " syndrome . < br / > < br / > there was nobody to care about , nobody to become interested in dramatically , and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances . < br / > < br / > a total disappointment . 
NEG i ' m both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about vietnam , and were never there . this movie is about as true about the whole vietnam war as the rodney king beating is true about all police officers . yes , bad things do ( and did ) happen , but in general the people there are just like you and me . they have morals , they are not killing machines , they do not all do drugs . atrocities were the exception in vietnam , not the rule . they happened far more infrequently than the " hype " would lead you believe . oliver stone has a knack for making movies that show the vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath , but are based as much in reality as star wars . if you honestly believe the stereotypes of vietnam , do yourself a favour and learn the truth . fact : the viet cong and nva did far worse things to the south vietnamese than any soldier in the us armed forces ever did . fact : the soldiers in world war ii treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in vietnam did , and they were welcomed when they came home . the fine americans who served this country in vietnam deserve our respect ; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint , no one could have asked for more from our soldiers , and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of " mostly true " fiction is the way things really were there . 
NEG if you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters , this is the one . the acting is superb , both from john cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom , as the saying goes , they really are out to get , and from peter falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue . big mistake , but since they ' re both amoral mobsters , and misogynistic bastards to boot , it ' s hard to decide whom to root for less . only writer / director elaine may could have gotten away with this one . i thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer michael hausman included on the dvd , he disclosed that the two stars had " very different ideas " about the script , that the director was nearly impossible to work with , that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him , that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting , and so on . this mood of one big very dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen . 
NEG i can ' t even believe that this show lasted as long as it did . i guess it ' s all part of the dumbing down of america . personally , like david spade said , i liked this show better when it went by its original title - " seinfeld " . what bothers me the most about this show , aside from the obvious , base sense of " humor " , and general smuttiness , is the pretentious way the episodes are titled . truly great shows are still funny after many , repeated viewings , like , " the one where rob gets accidentally hypnotized " , on the " dick van dyke show " , or " the one where lucy and ethel work at the candy factory . " in other words , it ' s an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers . that the writers and producers of " friends " would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes , themselves , in such a fashion , before anyone ' s even had a chance to even see it a second time , speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers , but , also , of the stultified minds of their viewers . < br / > < br / > you read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark card - like neverland , full of greeting card sentiment . the true meaning of friendship ? i want to be a friend ? i want to live in manhattan ? wake up . these people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors , but they somehow manage to live in $ 4000 / mo . apartments ? get real . all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the idyllic new york life with your rosses and monicas , good luck with all of that . that new york doesn ' t exist for anyone making less than a serious six - figure income . but , good luck with all of that , anyway . now , shut - up and pass the soma . 
NEG this is a review of the wizard , not to be confused with the wiz , or mr . wizard . the wizard is a late - eighties film about a seriously silent boy ' s ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits . the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz , and mr . wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it . < br / > < br / > now that we ' ve gotten all that out of the way , let me say this : there ' s really no reason to see this movie . it ' s simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove , the legend of zelda and super mario brothers 3 . i use the word " designed " in the loosest sense possible , because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo , and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother . maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together , they ' d realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos . < br / > < br / > i hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you . it sure hasn ' t been for me . in fact , i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it . next time you ' re at the video store and you see the the wiz , the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row , give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead . 
NEG i saw this movie twice . i can ' t believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie . i ' m also a movie / theatre director and i know what i speak . this is not romania anymore , but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september . no story , no plot , nothing . no conclusion , no message , nothing profound , nothing hidden . just empty images . < br / > < br / > what most of romanians don ' t know , this movie is for the french viewers , not for us . they really believe that is the reality in romania . also for teenagers . pintilie should stop making movies . i don ' t really know if we can call this a movie , maybe a horror : ) and we wonder why we ' ve got such an image in europe . this was a reality , but isn ' t anymore . a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said : " you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu " . 
NEG shocking ! < br / > < br / > in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive . he was sincere , unpretentious and kindly , he was at ease and looked like well - educated and intellectual person . in this movie i saw a clown ! the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry . they made a cartoon ! the real gagarin was someone else ! don ' t believe in this movie ! < br / > < br / > i saw this movie after the movies like " taming of fire " and " apollo 13 " and after reading books " rockets and people " by chertok and " korolev : myths and facts " by golovanov . i was shocked by tiresome scenario , poor acting and producing , and a lots of inexactitudes of " space race " . < br / > < br / > the movie is the tedious rendering of well - known in russia historical facts . a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated . some facts and details were perverted . for example , in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner ( liberated in 1944 ) , and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine , but in special prison design bureau . korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners . but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 ( because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform ) . imho , the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can ' t to make interesting movies . 
NEG there is an awful lot wrong with this picture , beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant . courtney cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city . she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged ( craig sheffer ) , and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation . d . b . sweeny is a local cop , who is supposedly there to protect and serve . meanwhile , the script manipulates the audience as to who ' s really the good guy ? logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns , and there are more unanswered questions than there should be . if you think " blue desert " might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall , you will be disappointed . his part is insignificant , just like the entire movie . - merk 
NEG " laughter is a state of mind " says the tag , and i hesitate to comment on barry levinson ' s . what could he have been thinking during the making of " toys " ? when he watched the rushes , did he see a successful , funny fantasy ? if so , then he ' s working on a different plane than i . this is an excruciating picture , one in which the production design is 90 % of the thing ( and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment ) . robin williams and ( most especially ) joan cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies . there ' s nothing remotely funny ( satirical or slapstick - wise ) on display here . it is uniformly draggy , ugly , and one of the very worst " big " movies ever made . no stars from * * * * 
NEG i rate this movie with 3 skulls , only coz the girls knew how to scream , this could ' ve been a better movie , if actors were better , the twins were ok , i believed they were evil , but the eldest and youngest brother , they sucked really bad , it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them . . . . spoiler : if they ' re vampire ' s why do they freeze the blood ? vampires can ' t drink frozen blood , the sister in the movie says let ' s drink her while she is alive . . . . but then when they ' re moving to another house , they take on a cooler they ' re frozen blood . end of spoiler < br / > < br / > it was a huge waste of time , and that made me mad coz i read all the reviews of how this movie was great , how many awards this movie won , and this movie was f * * * * ing s * * t ! ! ! ! 
NEG though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series , bulldog drummond escapes , this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that ' s less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn ' t have the charisma of ray milland . < br / > < br / > that said , several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying . also john barrymore is present , popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises . < br / > < br / > anyway it ' s another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry . the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining . 
NEG this mini series , also based on a book by alex haley as was ` queen ' , tried to use similar formulas , that is , constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years . whereas in ` queen ' the result was masterful , here in mama flora the inspiration was lacking . firstly perhaps in the book itself , and most certainly in this tv production . too much is put in with too much haste over the years , such that the unfolding saga is shallow , superficial , not nearly so authentic as in ` queen ' . full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film , which was prepared with great care , but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian - forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration . i had hoped for more ; but evidently haley was less inspired with this tale than his near - biographical ` queen ' , and peter werner iii is no match for john erman . only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up . 
NEG ha . without a doubt tommy ' s the evil one here . i don ' t know why , but for some reason , little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches . and since they ' re kids , they won ' t die . because they ' re annoying . . . well . . except for asylum of terror . but those are few and far between . < br / > < br / > anyway onto the movie . can ' t find this movie on dvd ? sure you can ! all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack ! not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for $ 15 , but you also get 49 other movies ! what a bargain ! pff . ok . i ' m done advertising for these cheesy movies . let ' s just say , this movie ain ' t worth the 15 bucks on its own . < br / > < br / > so we have a chemist scientist . yeah . cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter . he ' s trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body . the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project , so he tries it on himself . but because this is a horror movie , he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3 / 4 of the movie . < br / > < br / > to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son . and she was never married ! scandalous ! but of course tommy is one of the most irritating characters . . . . no . i take it back . he is the most irritating character . far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter ' s work and gloats over him while he ' s in the hospital . that ' s right , even as an old cripple , you can still be the villain . < br / > < br / > so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he ' s the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal . however at the end he ends up de - evolving into a lizard . yeah , i know don ' t ask . the ending really doesn ' t make any sense . and if you ' re hoping for any really good payoff , you ' re not going to get it . < br / > < br / > this isn ' t a horrible movie . . . . it ' s just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff . if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list , you ' re not in for a snoozer , but you ' re also not in for a great movie . just sit back , relax , and eat a lot of snack food . because this movie isn ' t going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon . < br / > < br / > metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads , out of 10 . 
NEG all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place : dialog riddled with biological techno - babble , chintzy sets , balsa - wood acting , a horrific late - ' 80s casio score , and an overall look that suggests anything on the sci - fi channel ' s programming schedule , circa 1993 . though " metamorphosis " starts off with a lot of promise , the film unravels into bland idiocy and mst3k - style cheese as clark kent wannabe ' doctor ' peter houseman ( gene lebrock ) is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects . but when he tests his vague experiment on himself , he transforms into a vaguely - defined creature ( that bears more than a passing resemblance to ' dr . freudstein ' from " house by the cemetery " ) . the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously low - budget production ( though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason ) , but overall , " metamorphosis " leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts , in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise . i can ' t help but agree with one character ' s closing remark : " ( it was ) a nightmare . . . from the past ! " 
NEG boring stuff we got here . his 5 minute shorts are better than this . know why ? because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is . < br / > < br / > the plot is kinda . . . eh . . the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny = ( i had my hopes up , the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny . just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh . . not working . < br / > < br / > maybe next time knox . < br / > < br / > maybe re - cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good . 
NEG it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today . maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties , and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation , and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie , since so many people loved it . i found it foul and vulgar . i haven ' t said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill . the humor is sophomoric and crude . i am not a politically correct person , and even i found the gay jokes , not only not funny but downright offensive ( i ' m not gay ) . the main character in the movie is not even a likable person , just pathetic . when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see . 
NEG i don ' t understand the positive comments made about this film . it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made . < br / > < br / > cartoon characters abound - sue ' s foul - mouthed , alcoholic , layabout , irish father being a prime example . none of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except , briefly , for sue ' s asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence ! as desperately unattractive as they both are , i ' ve no idea why either rita and / or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob - but given that they do , why should i be expected to care what happens to them ? so many reviews keep carping on about how " realistic " it is . if that is true , it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film . < br / > < br / > i didn ' t like the film at all . 
NEG this self proclaimed " very talented artist " have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century . lack of emotion , coherence , rhythm , skills , humor . . . it repeats the same situation over and over again . it shows no character development . it does not even show any violent and / or sexual content , and it does not add anything new to the psycho - killer sub genre . so lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of " what not to do " in a first movie . < br / > < br / > btw where the hell is the " talent " ? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically ; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason . the camera almost never moves , as if the " very talented artist " was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills . the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs , and the supporting cast is hardly believable . there are more holes than plot in the script ( if ever there was one ) . . . < br / > < br / > a really disheartening movie , and a whatsoever talented director . 
NEG visually speaking , this film is stunning . it has some delightful black comedic moments . but on the whole , the plot is very clichéd , as is its seeming message . if you ' re a fan of over - the - top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw , you ' ll love it . if you ' re looking for something at all high - brow , steer away . i saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06 , and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing . ultimately , it isn ' t disturbing . just grinding and unpleasant to sit through . if you genuinely want to be challenged , go see something like the lost . if you want to be grossed out , or tell your friends about a really messed up film , then this is for you . 
NEG for a made - for - tv " horror " movie the movie started off very interesting . i was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film . but the ending was a total dissappointment . the movie was going along fast - paced and was building up to , it seemed like anyway , to a very climatic end . but guess what there is no end . the movie is just over and after almost one - and - a - half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened . why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered . there was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot . this film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it . very dissappointed . this film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film . a real bomb ! 
NEG in the beginning and throughout the movie , it was great . it was suspenseful and thrilling . yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened . they mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow ? it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore , was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be . 
NEG i love jane austen ' s stories . i ' ve only read two of them ( p & p and s & s ) , but after having seen this adaption , i ' m reaching for " persuasion " from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story , and also , because i refusing to believe jane austen could have written such nonsense . for me , i thought that if you base a film on a jane austen novel , you can ' t really go wrong . it will turn out great pretty much by default . i was wrong . < br / > < br / > first of all , where are the characters that you sympathise with and like ? you have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them , and this did not deliver . sure , i wanted anne and wentworth to get together , but only because that ' s what you know the purpose of the story is , them getting together . instead , i had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the tv and to continue watching it to the end . < br / > < br / > anne was utterly annoying throughout , and in the end , i really have no idea why wentworth was so smitten by her , as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to . she was meek , bland , dull , socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else ' s instructions rather than having a mind of her own . this can still work for a lead character , if you do it well . this wasn ' t done well . < br / > < br / > the other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism , of which mary was the worst , with a full - blown narcissistic personality disorder . where mrs . bennet in p & p had similar flaws , she was still endearing , whereas mary was more of a freak - show . more loathsome than funny . < br / > < br / > wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy . for the most part of the story , i was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he ' s in love with anne , as surely , he ' s the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more . . . alive ? acting - wise , not too much to say , as i reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good / bad the people acting were . anthony head was excellent , but as soon as i saw he was in it , i expected no less . < br / > < br / > also found the story very confusing . it wasn ' t until the end of the movie where it seemed as if elizabeth was not anne ' s stepmother , but in fact a sister ( i ' m still not 100 % on that ) . the whole anne / wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy . they had been together but then broke up and they ' re both bitter about it ? how come ? i was wondering this for quite some time , and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone ? but it was said in a kind of " by the by " way that it was almost missed , as if it was somehow unimportant . how can it be unimportant when it ' s the very core of the story ? ? there was also a lot of name - dropping , but no real feel for who the characters were . this louisa person for instance , who was she ? a friend ? family ? what ? it wasn ' t made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another . lady russell was there a lot , but why ? mrs . croft and wentworth were brother and sister , which felt very unrealistic as mrs . croft looked old enough to be his mother . < br / > < br / > the final kiss , yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street , but i didn ' t really think about it , because i was too busy yelling " get on with it already ! ! " at the tv , because anne ' s lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met wentworth ' s . have some hesitation there , but only for a couple of seconds or so , not half a minute . < br / > < br / > then there ' s the issue of camera work . as a regular movie watcher , you don ' t pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it . i didn ' t decide to do so here , but i still noticed them . to me , that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job . a lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups , something that should only be used when there ' s a really important point to be made . in this adaption , it was over - used and therefore lacked meaning . the hand - held feeling on occasion also didn ' t really work in a period drama . the camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary . ( not to mention the running itself . ) this was the only austen adaption i caught in itv ' s austen season . makes me wonder if it ' s worth watching " northanger abbey " and " mansfield park " or if i should just read the books and leave it at that . i ' m sad to say , this is a jane austen adaption i did not enjoy . maybe i ' ll watch the 1995 version instead . the bbc are renowned for having done beautiful austen adaptations before , after all . 
NEG i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one ' s heard of and could be a possible gem . i saw this and , since i ' m a fan of violence and gore , i got it . it got the rating of em which means : extremely mature . thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else , i got it . the warning on the box said : extreme violence , extreme langauge , and nudity . the " extreme violence " struck my fancy . the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick . it had one or two gory scenes but i ' ve seen worse in a pg - 13 movie . of course the amount of gore in a movie isn ' t all that counts , right ? you have plot also . well , the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it . don ' t rent it . i speak the truth . i can ' t imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say : " i ' m gonna rent that again . " it had it ' s moments where it kept you going but i ' m never going to see that film again . 
NEG the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep , engaging , powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show . among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well - acclaimed play . the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation ; which comes as a double - edged sword . on one hand , who better to translate the play than the original writer ? on the other hand , who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself ? doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense ; with a frustrating ending , unnecessary dialogue , questionable directing , and of course , the inability to provide substantial answers . it is a growing trend among these " high - caliber " films to not answer all questions it provides , and this has to stop . < br / > < br / > doubt is like a joke without its punch line , like a book with the final 20 pages missing , like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game , and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next . doubt , just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men , doesn ' t really end ; it doesn ' t provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending . yes , that was the intent , but this isn ' t a test of humanity , it ' s a cop - out . i do not pay money to see an unfinished work , i pay money to see a beginning , middle , and end , and pray that i don ' t fall asleep during the three acts . we are forced to become the " writers " of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other . < br / > < br / > this little drama is about a nun ( meryl streep ) who seems very sure that the well - beloved priest ( philip seymour hoffman ) is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church ; the first african - american boy in the catholic church . the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone ' s backs . the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently , which attracts the notice of a young teacher ( amy adams ) . the story is set right after the assassination of john f . kennedy , which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other . < br / > < br / > doubt ' s strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever - engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over . streep seems to be oscar - worthy in every role she ' s in , and here she is no different as her sternness and cold - hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church . hoffman excels yet again as the priest , by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura . the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off , especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time ; but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers . when these two argue , you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched . but let ' s not forget amy adams ( enchanted ) and viola davis ( law ad order ) for their superb job either . doubt ' s casting ensemble is among the best in 2008 . < br / > < br / > yet , like previously stated it ' s the writing and directing that ruins this film , especially when dwindling down the third act . questions pop up , but they aren ' t answered . characters pop up , but provide no real enhancement towards the plot . kids behave different , but we never truly find out why . there are awkward angles in the camera - work and there ' s no actual reason why . john patrick shanley , the writer of the play , had one previous film in his directing repertoire : joe versus the volcano . whether sheer arrogance or stupidity , we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation , utter annoying chatter that bores to no end ( there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted ) thanks to mr . shanley . < br / > < br / > bottom line : the lack of an ending is a stupid trend that ' s just as irritating as the seizureific camera - work in action films . it doesn ' t matter that we have a great talented acting cast , or decent cinematography , or a good story being worked upon , or good usage of sound and music ; because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn ' t even finish ! the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate , because we have the original madmen behind the project  but he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well . this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high - profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end : sideways , cast away , no country for old men , burn after reading are a few examples . < br / > < br / > newsflash : end your stinkin ' movie . please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank ( like wall - e ' s depressing backstories ) , instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness , confusion , and mental anguish . have a beginning , middle , and the end please ! ! as a critic , i prefer my films to be whole , not incomplete . doubt feels incomplete , which is why it gets an incompetent grade . < br / > < br / > someone has to break this stupid trend . 
NEG throw this lame dog a bone . sooo bad . . . you may watch anyway . kol ( ross hagen ) is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship commander ( jan - michael vincent ) . kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on earth . an unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive . john phillip law plays a forest / park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far , far away . costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence . vincent surely took the money and ran . law shows the only sign of effort . so bad it is almost comical . also in the cast : dyana ortelli , p . j . soles and dawn wildsmith . 
NEG some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made . well , they are only partly right . for me , this is the worst movie ever made period ! i have never seen anything so basely crude , and insulting , and vile , and against human nature as this film . a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry , this isn ' t even so bad , its good . there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis ' other bad movies like clambake . this one is so rotten to sit through its painful . pure garbage . native americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here . actually , perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars , seriously . grade : f 
NEG ok , the portrayal of the stereotyped ' indians ' in this story is just plain wrong . i do agree that elvis looks rather good here , but yeah , his skin color does seem to change during the movie . i was thinking , ok , . . . he was never that tan in real life . it ' s some of the most obvious brown ' indian ' makeup that i have ever seen . it ' s as bad as the ' indians ' on ' f - troop ' and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans ! < br / > < br / > this movie is o . k . , but typically lame story and mediocre songs , like in all of elvis ' later films . he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible ! i keep thinking ' thank god ' that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out . it is cool to see character actors joan blondell , katy jurado , l . q . jones , henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie , though . < br / > < br / > burgess meredith ' s ' indian ' makeup is absolutely awful . it ' s the worst of the bunch for sure . what were the filmmakers thinking ? was mr . meredith doing this one just for the money or what ? i do love certain elvis movies , though . for example : ' love me tender ' , ' jailhouse rock ' , ' viva las vegas ' . i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co - stars mary tyler moore and ed asner , ' change of habit ' in which elvis plays an inner - city doctor . < br / > < br / > oh well , at least elvis made a few good films , but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones . < br / > < br / > i ' ll always love elvis ! thank you , thank you very much ! 
NEG private practice is supposed to be a medical drama . so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines . just by watching house , i " solved " two ( out of nine ) medical mysteries before the doctors did . boooring . seriously , if you are a lazy writer , why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap ? house is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with . . . < br / > < br / > second biggest complaint : these people are supposed to be forty - somethings , right ? then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15 - year - olds ? is three weeks ( ie . three whole damn episodes ) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn ' t want to be your " friend with benefits " , it ' s maybe not because he wants to hurt you , but because he doesn ' t want to risk your friendship ? the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can ' t really buy into the supposed " drama " . < br / > < br / > and i won ' t even start complaining about what the show did to everyone ' s favorite addison as we got to know her in grey ' s anatomy . . . on a sidenote , don ' t you think it ' s funny the way addison ends up lusting after loser pete ( sorry , but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with mozart ' s requiem is a loser , phd or not ) and derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny , irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle ? apart from that little fling with mark , they seemed to be perfect for each other . sometimes i think shonda rhimes ' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships , our first choice is often the right one . . . 
NEG one wonders why this picture was made at all : the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous , the characters ( experienced loner cop versus younger one , quite fascinated ) quite predictable , the ending totally murky and impossible to understand ( maybe after several viewings but you ' d have to have a masochistic tendency for that ; the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it ' s all about ) and the acting is bad . was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include " seven " and " silence of the lambs " ? if so , it is a total failure . it was quite a success though ( and has a sort of cult - status as the first french serial killer film ) and , it seems , considered as a good product to export . strange . 
NEG this review is mostly all spoilers . if you plan on enjoying this film , don ' t read this review . < br / > < br / > that ' s the problem with kids tv nowadays . it ' s all so patronizing and condescending . ` wow , that was fun , wasn ' t it ? ' no it wasn ' t . and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well . and that is what ' flight of the reindeer ' is all about . admittedly i haven ' t seen ' flight of the reindeer ' in a few years so i might be hazy on some points , but i remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time . < br / > < br / > essentially , the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for christmas . now , the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal . i think it was bullfrogs . anyway , through this book , mr lecturer / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs . apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the north pole . now , if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window . flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon , but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept . but , mr lecturer isn ' t me , so i guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he ' s gone . of course , things go awry and before he knows it , a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he ' s stranded at the north pole . < br / > < br / > are you still following this ? good . < br / > < br / > his family , of course , are devastated . i would be too , i mean , what a suck - tacular christmas . elsewhere , mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white . rather than try to escape immediately , as i would have done , he greets everyone there with open arms . this hidden civilization of midget monsters , and he greets them with open arms . oooo - kayyyy . they feed him this story that they are the elves of santa claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist . and mr lecturer accepts all this . he even accepts that santa claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever . there ' s just one problem - they don ' t want him to leave . the world can ' t know of their secret existence . after all , before they ' d know it there ' d be a mcdonalds and a starbucks on every street corner . < br / > < br / > still with me ? < br / > < br / > now , mr nice guy ' s family find the book and assume he ' s gone to the north pole . boy , wouldn ' t they be embarrassed if they found out he ' d just gone for a brisk walk ? before the audience knows it , they ' re jetting off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet . meanwhile , mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave . i can ' t remember exactly , but i do recall him holding santa claus to gunpoint . a fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via santa ' s sleigh . with santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes , mr whatever , through some marvellous co - incidence , finds himself flying alongside his family ' s plane that is looking for him . so he jumps on to their plane , the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after . < br / > < br / > the fact is , there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it . and it ' s that charm that is utterly devoid from ' flight of the reindeer ' there isn ' t much wrong with it ; nothing which insults the intelligence ( well , obviously there is , but it ' s a kids film and thus can get away with such things ) or anything particularly offensive , but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either . it just doesn ' t feel christmassy . and for a film that is all about christmas , that it a pretty major flaw . but hey , i don ' t think ' flight of the reindeer ' s target audience mind about that ? why should they ? they ' re all so doped up on sedatives they probably couldn ' t spell ` christmas ' < br / > < br / > i give it three out of ten . if it was a tv - movie then i ' d add another two stars onto it . we all know how bad they can get . 
NEG why do movie makers always go against the author ' s work ? i mean , yes , things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest , but look at anne of green gables . they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful . i can ' t believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess . look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . paul irving , little elizabeth , the widows , windy poplars . . . and anne ' s college years , for heaven ' s sake ! ! ! wouldn ' t it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang ? kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time , instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did . this movie was good , if you leave the novels out of it ! ! but l . m . montgomery ' s beautiful work is something that should not be denied . this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life . 
NEG a battleship is sinking . . . its survivors , hanging onto a nearby liferaft , sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks . < br / > < br / > even though noel coward ' s name is the only one that you notice during the credits , everything that ' s cinematic in it is because of lean . and on technical terms , its very good . david lean just knew films from the get - go . there are many moments where coward ' s studied dialogue takes a second seat and lean ' s visual sense takes centre stage . try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end , and that whole scene ; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing , the scene where we ' re inside a house that gets bombed . < br / > < br / > noel coward is one of the worst actors i ' ve ever seen . he ' s totally wooden , not displaying emotion , character or humanity . you can see it in his eyes that he ' s not really listening to what the other performer is saying , he ' s just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line . < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 . < br / > < br / > its episodic , a bit repetitive , and the flashbacks overwhelm the story : there ' s no central story that they advance , just give general insights into the characters . still , its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for lean . its not a very deep or penetrating film , and its definitely a propaganda film , but its also a showcase for lean ' s editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together . 
NEG this movie ' s full title is " waqt : race against time " . that ' s a race no one can ever win , but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious " waqt " on this bakvaas . this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest . it strained my credulity too far . it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline , and deserves to be mocked for it . < br / > < br / > it ' s not quite as awful as baghban or black , but this movie has nothing to recommend it . stupid , pointless , with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji . the central " plot " is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many " family " bw films . if my father , who raised me , and who i love dearly , treated me like big b did akshay , i ' d shoot him myself . to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness . 
NEG to be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence , but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the cgi was a little old hat now . maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too . . to say this was awful is to do this film a mis - service , if you want to see something that is totally execrable , you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching ' sickle ' , that is soo mind numbingly awful , its actually good , ( several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though . any road up , i enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet , just don ' t expect anything along the lines of ' jurassic park , the lost world ' or ' apocalypto ' . 
NEG < br / > < br / > cheap - looking and ugly , this film didn ' t even seem to entertain the kids in the audience , except for one fairly amusing toilet joke . christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role , although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don ' t help . elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role . jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation . there is really no reason to make this movie , especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin williams ' s often brilliant improvisations in mork & mindy . < br / > < br / > 
NEG i think my summary sums it up . i found it inane and stupid . i also saw the ending a mile a way . everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a tv / theater crossover anymore . sometimes , it ' s better to let the movie stand alone . < br / > < br / > others , its better to forget the movie altogether . this is one of the others . . . . 
NEG i disliked this movie for numerous reasons . within the first ten minutes of the film , i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself , for me at least , that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug . unfortunately , that did not occur . the two draws of the movie for me were to see jane fonda and felicity huffman . i don ' t know enough about lindsey lohan ' s work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film . afterward , i just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were " moments " in each of their performances . i imagine that for each of them to find their " moments " was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog . although the plot is an interesting one , the movie on the whole is so poorly written , directed and edited that anybody ' s performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it . the disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small - town america , i think , were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it ' s mark . as one reviewer has noted and i would agree , the movie is almost impossible to market given it ' s finished form . i suspect that , or at least hope that ( for the actor ' s sakes anyway ) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor . sad for us but if that ' s true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop . oh yeah and another thing . . . i wished for just once i could go see an american movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren ' t absentmindedly and / or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans , smashed cds and , other such trash ! 
NEG it just seems to run true to form , any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad ! i don ' t know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes , or that dolph is such a bad actor . no spoiler here , he seems to overdue the pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching thing in this movie . in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre . 
NEG horrible film . about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl . boring . tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part , and has some of the corniest lines in film history . richard burton looks close to death in this film , and we ' re supposed to believe he looks " good for sixty " . the acting is bad , as is the plot . the characters are awful , as is the story . it ' s really hard to feel for anyone in this film , except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum , he ' s kind of funny . this movie is really a waste of time . if you are a tatum fan , like me - which is why i rented it in the first place - please don ' t see this movie . she is really bad in it , and you ' ll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke . it wasn ' t , because of bad news bears and little darlings it ' s known she can act well , but still , don ' t rent this movie . and if you ' re a fan of burton , rent something when he was good looking , and not a fossil . 
NEG saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film fest . < br / > < br / > what can i say ? against my better judgment , i liked it , but it seemed to me that that acting was a little . . . weak ( mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy ) . i mean , the script wasn ' t stellar to begin with , but the actors didn ' t make me believe the relationships . < br / > < br / > the plot is also predictable . < br / > < br / > nonethelss , i liked it . the characters are likable , and the plot is not challenging or upsetting . it ' s sweet , the characters care about each other , and i don ' t count it as fifty minutes ill - spent . < br / > < br / > but i don ' t recommend it . 
NEG hollywood ' s attempt to turn jack london ' s life into a " jack london " adventure film isn ' t a bad idea ; certainly , he led an interesting , and sometimes adventurous , life . this film , however , winds up flat and unsatisfying . most importantly , it lacks integrity . michael o ' shea ( as london ) has some londonesque speeches ; and , it ' s nice to see his bearded jack receive " the call of the wild " after spending some quality time alone , in the snowy mountains , with his dog , " buck " . virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty . the film draws unfortunate " yellow peril " parallels between london ' s life and world war ii , which are both strained and insulting . < br / > < br / > * * jack london ( 11 / 24 / 43 ) alfred santell ~ michael o ' shea , susan hayward , virginia mayo 
NEG the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the " hope " to see something interesting . the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really , really bad , honestly , i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad . < br / > < br / > the first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was : " she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director " . . . surprise , surprise , next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife . awful story and terrible performance . 
NEG had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix , i ' d have a couple of hours of my life back . i ' m frankly suspicious when i see that a film ' s director also wrote it . in this case , according to the credits , the same guy was " writter and director " - unfortunately , an indication of the overall quality of this production . there were a few interesting moments ( e . g . , judy tenuta ' s scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy - ism ) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one . those moments , however , were few and far between . . . and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me , not to mention reprehensible in its violence . i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i ' d seen the whole thing . nope , though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later . the " spinning camera " technique was overused and essentially pointless . i found myself talking to the tv screen : " what ? ! ? " or " for goodness sake , get on with it ! " not recommended . 
NEG my god , what ' s going on ? a uwe boll film and positive comments ? wow ! < br / > < br / > nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to boll ' s work . i myself , as i have stated in previous uwe boll reviews , only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good . i mean . . it must happen one day ! < br / > < br / > alas , seed is not that day . i don ' t quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that seed is . the thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net . . . . . or so mr boll believes . i still can ' t for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film . i understand the concept that seed ( the killer ) is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff . . . . . but can ' t understand why mr boll thought putting real footage in the film would work . maybe to shock us ? hmmm . . . . . well , i for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film . i don ' t though , find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest . if you were trying to shock me , it didn ' t work . it just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because uwe boll is allowed to continue making films . this sort of context may have worked for films in the 70 / 80 ' s ( cannibal holocaust ) but not todays market . < br / > < br / > with that out of the way , we can move on to the fact that uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like bloodrayne 2 . you can just tell that there wasn ' t a huge amount of money floating around for production . < br / > < br / > as per usual , mr boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of seed ' s victims in the first 25 mins . each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim . it ' s all very boring and tedious . i won ' t comment on the toddler scene as it ' s laughable and just another cheap ' shock ' factor . < br / > < br / > if you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch seed . the lighting here is horrible and uwe has the old ' i ' m not using a steady cam ' fiasco that he did with bloodrayne 2 . watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as seed is caught . this scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it . the cop actually tells seed he could have shot him . for some un - be - known reason , the cop doesn ' t shoot him . given that seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults , you ' d have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail . < br / > < br / > from here we are treated to a stupid execution scene , followed by the cops burying seed alive ( and they know he is alive . . why not shoot him in the head ? ? ? ? ) , followed by seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop ' s family . < br / > < br / > what i ' m trying to get across to you all here is that it ' s just plain stupid ! it ' s not even hollywood horror stupid . . . . just plain dumb . uwe boll can not direct * * * * . anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement . anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person . < br / > < br / > once again we are treated to a poorly acted , directed , lighted , produced , scripted piece of ub crap . 
NEG while not as bad as his game - to - movie adaptations , this hunk of crud doesn ' t fare much better . < br / > < br / > boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesn ' t make good movies . one of these days he ' ll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs . < br / > < br / > the acting was sub - par , the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompters and boll ' s special little ' touches ' were seen throughout the whole thing . < br / > < br / > like all uwe boll movies , this one just shouldn ' t exist . < br / > < br / > plain and simple . < br / > < br / > just like uwe boll himself shouldn ' t exist . > _ > 
NEG wow , this movie was so horrible . i ' m so glad i didn ' t have to pay money to see this horrible movie . it was like a history nut went on a coke binge ! the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad . i will say the idea sounded decent but come on . it was really really bad . if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic . come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with . it wasn ' t like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle . it was completely ridiculous , and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one . all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top 10 worst films i ' ve ever seen . 
NEG and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood style . < br / > < br / > this was senseless ridiculous rubbish . < br / > < br / > its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived , poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen . it is appalling . < br / > < br / > nic cage ' s brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over . i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films . < br / > < br / > diane kruger proves that her performance in troy was no fluke , she really can ' t act . < br / > < br / > harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe . < br / > < br / > only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that america invented the world . 
NEG this movie is a lot like the movie hostel , except with * bad * acting and not much suspense . the gore elements are there , but you don ' t really feel anything for the characters , making the violence not very effective . some parts are just strange . . . like forcing a snake down someones throat . what ' s up with that ? is that supposed to be scary or gory ? it ' s just kind of stupid . as for torture , there really isn ' t any ( except for the guy getting blow - torched in the beginning , which they don ' t show anyway ) . the main bad guy keeps saying " make them die slowly " , yet the butcher kills them all very fast . the deaths are all relatively quick . yes , i did watch the " unrated " version . so , overall , not the worst gore movie i ' ve seen , but not at all good either . you won ' t miss anything if you skip this one . 
NEG first i ' d like to excuse my bad english . < br / > < br / > i ' m not a hostel - hardcore - fan , but i liked that movie nevertheless . live feed , however , sucked big time ! i have never seen a gore - movie with superb acting , but hey , who ' s surprised ? the acting in live feed was . . . well , not there ! i ' ve seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something . okey , but not by students in media or acting school . this was no class at all ! and what about the story ? a really sad rip - off on hostel . and what about the gore ? what about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold - sweating ? that was the most disappointing about the hole movie ! short , quick and no edge . more like an execution rather than a torture . okey , there where buckets of blood , but it didn ' t even look real . the slaughtering and the violence reminded more of braindead than hostel or any of the saw - movies . and braindead was fun ! okey , i laughed at live feed a couple of times , but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun ! < br / > < br / > so instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching live feed , watch anything else ! 
NEG where to even start ? the horrendous acting ? the nonsensical plot ? the bargain basement effects ? the completely loathsome characters ? the choppy editing ? the headache - inducing casio keyboard score ? ? ? the embarrassingly racist remarks ( " watch it , charlie ! " , " back off , jackie chan ! ! " ? ? ? the constant misogyny ? ? ? i am a lifelong horror fan , and i have no problem at all with the current " torture - thon " trend of movies . however , this is a poorly - made piece of garbage . i think i suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it ! if you like girls being forced to eat stir - fried penis , really poor soft core porn and think lines like " i ' m gonna find that b * * * * and staple her c * * * shut ! ! " are clever , live feed is for you . < br / > < br / > as for me , i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again ! 
NEG first of all , the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes . . . half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes . aren ' t there enough brown - eyed actors out there ? jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves . he was a full - blooded jew ! second of all , what is it with old english - language movies that are supposed to take place in non - english - speaking countries , and everybody has english accents ? ( another example is david lean ' s " dr . zhivago " . ) aren ' t there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent ? the movie often is not true to the scriptures , and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesus ' s claim to be the messiah . in the bible , when jesus is baptized by john , a voice comes from heaven saying " this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased " ( matthew 3 : 17 , mark 1 : 11 , luke 3 : 22 ) . in the movie , john the baptist says this ! the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy , as well . for example , in the bible , the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god ( luke 1 : 26 - 38 ) , but in the movie , we do not see or hear any angel - mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam , and when mary ' s mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her , she doesn ' t hear or see anyone either . also , in the movie , when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem , he says , " you shall not see me here again , not until you learn to cry , ' blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord ' , for i and my father are one and the same . " the correct line ( matthew 23 : 39 and luke 13 : 35 ) is " you will not see me again until you say , ' blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord . ' " period . jesus never claimed to be god . the movie cuts out a lot of important parts ( the sermon on the mount is very expurgated ) , but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn ' t even in the bible ( a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john ) . it seems like the screenwriter , instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures , wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind ( and between ) the scenes . the movie has one gem though - during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son , at matthew the tax collector ' s house , i had tears streaming down my face . it is the best movie i ' ve seen about jesus ' s ministry ( but that isn ' t saying much , because the others are just terrible ) . " jesus christ superstar " is my favourite movie about jesus ' s last days ( " the passion of the christ " is way too graphic ) , though i like how " jesus of nazareth " , instead of just ending with jesus ' s death , continues on and shows his resurrection . 
NEG i don ' t usually comment , but there are things that need to be said . where to start . . . < br / > < br / > the acting , on jeremy london ' s part was horrible ! i didn ' t think he could be so bad . the plot could have been good , had it been well directed , along with a good solid performance from the lead actor . unfortunately , this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining , but get disappointed from the start . < br / > < br / > well , at least i got good laughs . i wouldn ' t waste my time if i were you . 
NEG this movie isn ' t very good . it ' s boring , and not much blood for a horror film . the plot just trods along with not much happening . and i think the female vampire was so stupid . she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes . but , whenever she has one of them pinned , she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn ' t bite them . no wonder this went straight to cable . < br / > < br / > final verdict : not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie . you ' re a sucker if you waste your time on this . 
NEG well , i was excited at first to download an animated open source movie , only to be ruined by a demo reel . the animation is excellent , the lip syncing is awful , and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what ' s going on , only to realize nothing is going on . you feel no emotion for the characters , only pity for the creators for wasting their time . i have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time ! this could of been an excellent short film , if they had just taken the time to hire a real director . i ' m sure everyone over at blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities , but sorry guys - story telling is what makes a movie . 
NEG i just have to add , in case anyone actually reads this and hasn ' t completely gotten the point yet . these other reviewers aren ' t joking around , this really is the worst colour movie you ' re likely to ever see . when the movie started i couldn ' t believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see . < br / > < br / > they ' re not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie . it really does . like the " director " took the family hi8 camcorder ( before dv cameras and computer non - linear editing ) , no other equipment ( lights , sound gear , etc ) , grabbed some decent - looking acting students , and went out to shoot a movie . no script , just making it up as he went along . < br / > < br / > when i watched it , it was on my mono tv , so i only have one channel of audio ( left of right speaker ) . at first i thought i ' d hooked it up wrong . the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in . i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn ' t hear the dialog . they recorded the sound on different bloody channels ! i mean , there ' s movies that can be funny to watch , so bad they ' re good , kind of thing . i ' m not sure this is one of those . i mean , i ' ll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker . and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better , you know . but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it . < br / > < br / > as bad as they were , the actors are the only good thing about this . i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene . a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 . but alas , no . if you want to make a movie but it ' s turning out crap , throw in some gratuitous nudity . worked for roger corman . 
NEG first of all , jon bon jovi doesn ' t seem to be in place in a vampire movie . together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable . if you keep that in mind and you ' re a total vampire movie fan , you can have some fun with a few of the scenes . don ' t expect any tarantino - style chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline . ( i expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow ; ) 
NEG i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better . don ' t get me wrong , it ' s not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it ' s potential . the premise is good , the cast is great ( i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton ) and , god love ' em , you can tell everyone tried their best . it just falls short over and over again . " brutal massacre " should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and , despite the fact he makes it look easy , you should probably just forget trying to do the same . naughton and brian o ' halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often . . . they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me . if you ' re going to have the " spinal tap " of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made " spinal tap " to helm it . . . just thinking out loud there . 
NEG i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie . < br / > < br / > the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic . steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor . he has no passion in his play . also the action in the original " getaway " was fantastic . but the remake has no action ! it is almost boring despite the fact that the film - making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 . < br / > < br / > i don ' t understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico . i think this is a mistake in the story . < br / > < br / > so i think that there was no need to remake it , or if they decided to remake a classic , they must choose an excellent actor for the first role , like johnny depp or brad pitt . . . 
NEG drawing restraint 9 . dir : matthew barney . < br / > < br / > how do you know when you ' re in the middle of a pretentious art film ? is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film ? is it when bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo - asian ritual ? maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment . or , when you ' re about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal , and still annoying , version of a philip glass score ? in any case , drawing restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies . at 135 minutes , it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot . i would call the use of color stunning , and the opening sequence interesting , but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a discovery channel documentary . that is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of p - ss christ , but that will be coming up later . < br / > < br / > actually , the documentary - esquire portions were the best parts of it . the surface plot is about a whaling ship , and then there is a ritual about making whale fat . then , there are the guests in the form of bjork and matthew barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed - out head shaving ( think frat boy pranks ) , nicotine patches , and giant furry pita hats . then there is mutual evisceration , cannibalism , and lets not forget the giant turd . < br / > < br / > matthew barney has written that this is about " the relationship between self - imposed resistance and creativity . " that ' s almost like saying , " if you don ' t get it , then you ' re not creative in your interpretation , so sod off because i ' m an artist . " oh , wait , that ' s the post - modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was post - modern . but , its supposed to be modern art . which is about the art itself . < br / > < br / > so , let ' s start this whole interpretation bit , shall we ? the following lines are only 3 / 4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie . < br / > < br / > the first half - hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp . obviously , the ramp is symbolic of the need for self - elevation to whatever standards you hold dear , and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom . then , on a whaling ship , they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale . obviously a crude element of foreshadowing . < br / > < br / > on the ship , they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale , and take out the fins portion . they replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd . these are supposed to be the states of the movie itself . when its fat , its entertaining but bad for you . when it is the spinal column , its the " important " parts of the movie , or the backbone so to speak . then , the giant turd is the bowels of the movie , or when the movie is crap . < br / > < br / > bjork and matthew barney the arrive on separate ships , are put into strange humiliating outfits which aren ' t even well made or symmetrical , one suspects that they ran out of money and barney was trying to quit smoking . so , they put patches on his head . they go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a japanese wise man , who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it ; a crash or intersection , if you will . this inspires bjork and barney , who are different on the outside , to start cutting each other ' s legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person . they intersect . oh , did i forget to mention that this has been done in a robbie williams video ? then , the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid venn diagram . barney made it through 8th grade geometry , obviously . or , maybe at least some social studies . < br / > < br / > oh , and did i forget bjork ' s ear - gouging i - want - to - kill - her score ? at times it is hypnotic , but at others you just want to assassinate her . < br / > < br / > art film is one thing , but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people , it becomes a self - destructive joke . when do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art ? dali and bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and / or entertaining than this piece of trash . un chien andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour . < br / > < br / > so , can i recommend this ? only if you like dull high art films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery . < br / > < br / > d + 
NEG spoiler below , but read on or you ' ll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planing to rent " rodentz " . < br / > < br / > on a moonlit night , in a remote research laboratory , a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results . a chemical compound that was created to " hunt and destroy " deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system into the building ' s basement . now , the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species . professor schultz , a leading bio - researcher , has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now enables his " hunt and destroy " formulation to regenerate for the length of time necessary to neutralize deadly cancer tumors . when three varying degrees of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest poured down the faulty " waste hazard " sink , shocking side - effects result in a night of terror . . . . . right . . . . . < br / > < br / > seriously , this is probably the worst film i ' ve seen this year . everything about it screams " low - budget ! " , from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst i ' ve ever seen . the characters are clichéd morons and act in stupid , predictable ways : walking down dark hallways alone , looking for a cat , tripping and falling so the " rats " can catch up with them , boarding themselves up in a small room , etc . < br / > < br / > while some films are cheaply made , this film really takes the cake . every possible corner is cut , everything from reusing earlier shots , filming the " lab " hallways from different angles to make it look bigger ( that reminds me - - why were only two guys working in this freakin ' massive building ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ) , to music and special effects that could be done on a children ' s workshop pc . < br / > < br / > that brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung - - the special effects . just horrendous . the computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated . and that giant rat suit - - oh my god ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! seriously , are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster ? just pitiful . . . . . . . . on the better side , some of the gore looks pretty cool , especially considering the budget . < br / > < br / > the actors all suck . no one involved with the production cared or knew what they were doing . i ' ve wasted enough time with review , just take my advice , it ' s garbage . 1 / 10 . < br / > < br / > about the dvd : the transfer sucks , the audio is passable and there ' s a commentary track on the disk by the director and two of his friends , who say they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but were there to ask questions and make comments . all three of these sub - human primordial slime are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others . i don ' t want to waste any more of you kind reader ' s time or mine , for i am starting to remember more than i want to about this film . . . . . dvd rating : 1 / 10 . 
NEG for me the only reason for having a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be . there was no doubt about it being funny and bad , because i had seen " voyna i mir " ( 1968 ) . shall we begin ? here we go . . . < br / > < br / > robert dornhelm & brendan donnison ' s pierre bezukhov - a lean fellow that lacks the depth of the original ; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison ' s natasha rostova - a scarecrow , her image can cause insomnia ; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison ' s andrej bolkonsky - an ok incarnation which , like the lean fellow ( cf . above ) , lacks depth of a russian soul and " struggle within " ; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison ' s napoleon - a rather unimpressive leader ; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison ' s prince bolkonsky - a turd with an english face ; robert dornhelm & brendan donnison ' s count bezukhov - a spineless freak - show . . . < br / > < br / > the rest of the characters are not much better . < br / > < br / > the movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious . they behave like modern eu citizens dressed up for a one - day masquerade . it all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our russian men and women of the early 19th century . < br / > < br / > a good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of . we had quite a few giggles in our office when remembering this modern product , which had been shown the previous evening on our tv . < br / > < br / > " user rating : 8 . 0 / 10 ( 29 votes ) " - i guess , many young people have never watched our film ( " voyna i mir " 1968 ) or have weird sense of " tarantino - spielberg " quality . remember the scene when our hussar is saving his friend , turns around , shoots , and the bridge goes boom ? looks like a cgi explosion . < br / > < br / > there is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel , which was screened properly in our country once . but i would be happy to watch a russian remake of " gone with the wind " . hey , directors , wake up and get busy with that , instead of spoiling our classics . < br / > < br / > now back to common sense . jokes aside . what i mentioned above is nothing new , though deadly exaggerated . < br / > < br / > to make foreign actors trying to pass for russians ( while participating in very serious epics and dramas ) is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again . of course it results in numerous laughs - especially clemence poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a russian viewer think : " this sucks so much that it ' s funny ! " ) . < br / > < br / > in order to say something new , i ' d like to mention the pace of the movie . to my mind , this new version is very patchy . the narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing - they stagger and pop up like in a modern video . again i have to remember our " voyna i mir " , where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy " going with the flow " . < br / > < br / > i thought that maybe the borodino battle would be great ( to somehow rehabilitate numerous drawbacks ) but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968 . < br / > < br / > there should be something good in this movie after all . and there is . the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work . they did not have a chance from the start but they still joined " the losers ' team " . plus 1 point for that recklessness . it makes a russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best . it all evokes pity , and sometimes - fits of laughter . < br / > < br / > what i still like about this serial is the last part of it . it shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her " salary and taxes " . besides , judging by the movie trailers i thought that the film would have an adult sex scene , which would definitely kill the whole project . but , fortunately , it does not have such rubbish . and that ' s a big plus . < br / > < br / > " voyna i mir " is no " harry potter " and nowadays even we , here in present - day russia , do not have enough craft to film it properly . do i have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely ? fortunately , a proper film was screened during our soviet times . the american version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - ours did not even exist yet . there were extenuating circumstances then . < br / > < br / > 4 out of 10 ( 1 point is given from the start , 1 point goes for the recklessness , and 2 points for the last part of the serial . thanks for attention . 
NEG i am a big movie fan . i like movies of all types . this is arguably the worst movie i ' ve ever seen . < br / > < br / > i get that it follows the book closely , which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie . especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once . < br / > < br / > these characters are not quirky , they are mentally ill . the things that happen are not funny , they are disturbing ; especially considering they are supposed to be true . < br / > < br / > this movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums , another movie i hated , only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny . < br / > < br / > i will never get those hours back . i wanted to wash my brain after watching . 
NEG first of all , i firmly believe that norwegian movies are continually getting better . from the tedious emotional films of the 70 ' s and 80 ' s , movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour . imagine . . actual comedies were made ! movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny , as opposed to long , dark , depressing and boring . < br / > < br / > during the 90 ' s and 00 ' s several really great movies were made by a ' new generation ' of filmmakers . movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money . it became the norm ! < br / > < br / > then came united . . . < br / > < br / > * minor spoilers * it ' s just simply not funny . not once . not ever . but the thing is . . . we think its funny . because we ' re used to norwegian movies to be funny . especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians . but . . they neither say nor do anything funny ! where ' s the humor ? show me the humor ! is it the awkward clerk played by harald eia ? is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach ? is it the commentaries by arne scheie ? the movie is just not funny ! < br / > < br / > but thats not my main rant about united . that namely is the predictability . ( and it is here i fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since i have seen this in many other movies as well . ) all the time you just know its going to end well . all characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie , and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end . there ' s absolutely no room for surprises at all ! < br / > < br / > all in all i can say that i sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie . it was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making . . . again ! < br / > < br / > rating : 1 / 6 
NEG the opening 5 minutes gave me hope . then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie . absolute lowest common denominator humor . painful viewing . a complete chore . written no doubt in less than a week , just like the first one . give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell . and don ' t let him out until he ' s developed a decent script for something , anything . he has it in him . these austin powers things are just embarrassing . < br / > < br / > let goldmember sink without trace . 
NEG not exactly my genre , this straight - to - dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers . i ' m relatively open minded , and quite a fan of eamonn walker , so i sat back ready to enjoy myself . < br / > < br / > blood and bone is the story of isiah bone , an ex - con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses . blah blah blah . < br / > < br / > what a tedious film . i understand that films like this don ' t rely hugely on plot , but do they have to stuff in such a silly , predictable and entirely stupid storyline ? it may not be important , but by golly gum does it annoy me . better no plot and pure action than a clíche - ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative . infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel , it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin - skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards . i should probably at this point mention what is , of course , the film ' s drawing point : the fighting . even in itself , the fighting is rather poor . bone manages to take out well established tough - man street fighters in single punches ( a large oaf or two is the filmmakers ' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency ) ; fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy . even this is repetitive and stupid , arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again . < br / > < br / > a run of the mill , film - by - numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status , doing absolutely nothing new and everything we ' ve seen time and time again . and not even particularly well . 
NEG creep - " your journey terminates here . " some very graphic scenes and . . . well , yeah , that ' s about all for this film . < br / > < br / > no real plot , no storyline . no likable characters , well , ' characters ' isn ' t correct considering you don ' t have a clue who anyone really is . i mean , they are being chased by some weird looking ' thing ' in the sewers ( who is this thing ? why is he there ? ) , that ' s quite scary i guess , but do i really care ? no , i don ' t . why don ' t i ? because i don ' t have a clue who these people are and i don ' t know if i should want them to live or die . it ' s one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you , which it rarely does . < br / > < br / > this film lacks any meaning , any purpose . it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up . it jumps right into the action . basically , some women and her friends get locked in the london underground , get chased by a weird creature , then they eventually escape from it . < br / > < br / > creep has its moments which make you jump , the art is good , the location is excellent and the sounds are ok , but that isn ' t what makes a decent horror film , so unfortunately all that goes to waste . < br / > < br / > it ' s nothing new . another predictable modern ' horror ' , where kate ( the lead ' character ' ) consistently does the stupid " hey , i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation , but , oooh no ! i ' m going to do the total opposite because i ' m a dumb blond " thing . i wish they wouldn ' t do that , it ' s done so many times , it ' s boring and gets predictable . in fact , i ' m pretty annoyed the silly woman didn ' t get stabbed by the , erm , grey alien - looking creature . < br / > < br / > " your journey terminates here " is the films tag line . well , creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film . if you ' ve had a few beers , got a couple of mates back at yours , then sure , watch it by all means . but if you want something original and clever , avoid . 
NEG ' thunderbirds ' was an immensely popular sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now , with both adults and children alike , as it was in its heyday . so , one would deduce the chance to produce a live - action feature film with a million pound hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with ' spider - man ' and ' the x - men ' . but a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies ' section . < br / > < br / > instead of a film focusing on the five tracey sons , their father and trusty geek brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains , our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteen - year - old alan tracey , fourteen - year - old tin - tin and ten - year - old brain - box fermat , son of brains ( yes , brains ' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried ; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish ) . as one can tell from a run - through of our three lead characters , this 2004 remake ' thunderbirds ' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age - range as those involved in the much superior revival of ' spider - man ' did . the plot itself was so bland with clunky , awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn ' t amuse brighter pre - teens . the scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off ' spy kids ' ( which was at least quirky and original ) instead of remaking the show people know and love . < br / > < br / > although sophia myles and ron cook were excellent as miss penelope and parker , they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt . bill paxton ' s jeff tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four tracey boys while anthony edwards and ben kingsley , as brains and the hood respectively , were just embarrassing . the hood , in particular , is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy , two - bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce . < br / > < br / > brady corbet , who plays alan tracey , may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for vanessa anne hutchinson as tin - tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for ' girl power ' . ironically , it is young soren fulton ' s fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance . < br / > < br / > ' thunderbirds ' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances ! ' thunderbirds ' the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop . 
NEG if you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book , please don ' t give up on the series . i bought my first copy of any of the books in may of this year , and already i ' m almost finished with book 10 . i dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn ' t do the series even a sniff of justice . while " left behind : the movie " only vaguely follows the story of the " left behind " ( the book ) , the characters aren ' t even close to accurate . < br / > < br / > a few examples : rayford never acts on his feelings for hattie ( he is about to when he ' s informed of the vanishings ) ; buck williams is a blonde haired , magazine writer , not a tv reporter ; chloe is at stanford , and a lot of the book details rayford wondering if she ' survived ' ; buck and chloe don ' t meet until much later , at a meeting in new york , set up by hattie ; irene and raymie are never ' in the book , ' rather just in rayford ' s flashback thoughts ; the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that rayford and hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs . . . etc , etc , etc . . . < br / > < br / > and that ' s just from the first movie ; they ' re about to release the third . please , even if you didn ' t like the movies , give the book series a chance . 
NEG i ' m not a fan of the left behind book series - the books are written at a 6th - grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science , technology , and politics . while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture , their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous ( an example is their explanation for the russian / arab invasion of israel ) . also , the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel . still , i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation . for a similar reason , i watched this film adaptation . i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor . the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over - acting . the script is rather bad , though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis . the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped . events feel scattered and disconnected . the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed . at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory . here , the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book . the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed , and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded . the music is schizophrenic . at times , it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture . at other moments , it reminds me of sitcom and mini - series music . and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn ' t belong in the film . i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane , but that ' s it . the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling . the film also suffers from the book ' s preachiness although its message isn ' t quite as in your face . in all , i found the movie just as disappointing as the series . this is not the film to rally christians around it . i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year . it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity . for an example of a compelling , intelligent , well - researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader ( who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach ) read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur . it ' s a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality . 
NEG yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money . just how commercial did this film prove . the film council , who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded , on one of the london undergrounds disused stations , for allowing this clichéd , dismal specimen to be committed to film , a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate , most notably deathline . amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute . it ' s a little bit too late then ! surely all those development executives , at the uk film council , could have noticed this at the script stage . add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare . 
NEG starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way , this " film " is yet another cheap slasher flick which amazes me how this was released . i have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular , in fact they are my favourites . but when they are done this bad , it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time . the story is as clichéd and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie / ghost guy . its not the story that sucks the most , its the atrocious acting and dialouge , home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack . not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making - these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it ' s night ? ? what the hell was the director thinking with this move ? what , he had only one day to film all this in ? he was scared of the dark ? ( is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black , though ) < br / > < br / > i guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed . im sure one of the " teens " plays bingo down the local pub - but she ' s 40 - 45 . < br / > < br / > anyway , good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time . 
NEG where to start , this movie started badly and ended badly ! it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat , seriously , my cat could have acted better than this lot . < br / > < br / > some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable , i would of rated this lower but they haven ' t got anything else ! so , heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission , don ' t bother with this one . i ' m still in shock that this could actually be released to the public , this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested . i gather you ' ve got the gist by now so i ' ll leave it up to you to decide . 
NEG there is this girl and she ' s running in the woods but she ends up at this woman ' s clinic and she wants an abortion . her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it . the whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic . i ' m not really pro - choice but i wanted the choice to kill this episode . i was laughing when i saw the baby come out and it went into the corner . the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too . i was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode . he just wanted to protect his daughter and i couldn ' t really blame him for what he did . i don ' t know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room . i was just laughing too hard and i would suggest watching " pick me up " instead of this episode . it wasn ' t the worst episode but it wasn ' t that great . 
NEG to put it simply , the fan was a disappointment . it felt like as if i was watching taxi driver , except taxi driver was much better than this . it seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for robert deniro ' s character 100 percent . this approach didn ' t work . 
NEG the tortuous emotional impact is degrading , whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all . this movie has a plot , but it is all evil from start to end . this is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie . teen killing - bad preteen sex - bad emotional battering - bad animal cruelty - bad psychological torture - bad parental neglect - bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red , blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace , what a bad mistake to make , or to watch . . . it is ugly 
NEG almost a two - person play , and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important . neither are particularly good . this might have been stronger , in fact , if it had first been crafted as a two - person play , and then worked into a film . < br / > < br / > anyway , a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper ( as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home ) . he wants to have her tell him about the daylight . he would have been better off finding someone with a day job , or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet , but then they might not have a hot bod . < br / > < br / > after he gets her to do whatever he wants ( and he ' s not terribly good at it ) , he intends to feed on her at 6 am , at which point the sun rises . much is made of that deadline , despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding , it will just make him hungrier . additionally , he claims he can ' t let the stripper go , since she knows about him , but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is . there are a lot of inconsistencies . < br / > < br / > why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime , i ' m not sure . with all the time in the world , you ' d think he ' d have done a better job , or fixed the place up a bit . he ' s clearly not a wealthy vampire . < br / > < br / > this is supposedly a remake , and i ' m curious to see the original version of this , dance of the damned . although , that was directed by katt shea , and the other films she directed for corman ( stripped to kill , stk ii ) were pretty bad . 
NEG " fungicide " is quite possibly the most incompetent , embarrassing , pitiful " film " i have ever seen . the acting is criminal , the direction practically non - existent , and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer . < br / > < br / > far be it from me to stifle creativity , but i actually believe things like this shouldn ' t be made . i am sure the " film " - makers will say that , yes , the " film " was hampered by a low ( as in nothing ) budget - but in that case they just really shouldn ' t have bothered . as it is , they have offered the world something so dire , so execrable , that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it . < br / > < br / > starting the " movie " it wasn ' t as though i was expecting " citizen kane " or anything . i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness , a hint of fun , and even some energy . what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief . < br / > < br / > the plot ? well , our leering antihero scientist , who works in his parents ' basement , is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup . apparently , such high - level science is the end - result of years of research . his parents then send him off to a strange hotel - type place in the countryside to relax . there are some other people there , who are simply too awful to write about . anyway , the scientist drops his test - tube onto some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people . ( wow , i ' m getting suicidal just writing the plot summary ) . our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar ( by attaching a " fuse " - really a piece of string - to it ) . the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon , destroying all the mushrooms . the end . ( thank goodness ) . < br / > < br / > that summary is as good as the " film " gets ( and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is ) . it really should never have got past this stage of development ( by which i mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons ) . somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said " no . " < br / > < br / > and those " special " effects . well , they ' re " special " all right . this is cgi gone crazy . and done by a person who i can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology . and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package , they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet ( i kid you not ) . < br / > < br / > one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness . this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns ( a la clint eastwood ) and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets . i mean come on , a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off , but just to leave it as it is - really weak . < br / > < br / > i cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder - shot rubbish . the " film " - makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie - making equipment . < br / > < br / > i also think it ' s wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the " movie . " " fungicide " is an absolute travesty of film - making . mr wascavage is either very , very stupid or very , very cynical . 
NEG the only way we survived this stinker was by continually making fun of its stupidity . funny thing is none of the audience around us seemed to mind - - we all joined in . < br / > < br / > this movie is soooo bad , its only potential is to become a midnight cult movie that people can invent lines and throw popcorn at . 
NEG this is indeed quite the strange movie . . . first , we have an ex - u . s . - gymnast trying to turn actor ( or something ) , and this seems to be the only role he ever got ( that i know of anyway ) - - and for good reason . while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest , it is a rather bland and flat performance . second , we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie ! ! ! i ' m not kidding . this alone makes the movie extremely comical , but in that annoying way . hehe and third , while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast ( including the required hot chick ! ) , an actually not - so - bad story , and some cool visuals ; the dialogue , fight scenes involving gymnastics ( hilarious ! ) , and overall execution of the plot are weak . this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie ( too bad fox wasn ' t around in 1985 ) . it ' s one of those movies that ' s simply bad , yet you can ' t resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it , especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable . 
NEG so let me start off by saying that i saw this movie as part of a bargain . i was really bored one fine 1997 day and so i biked over to the movie rental store . i asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was . without hesitation he walked me over to " lucky stiff . " he told me that he ' d waive the $ 1 rental fee ( he said it would be wrong to charge more ) if i promised to watch the whole movie . so watch it i did , for free . . . < br / > < br / > this movie is terrible . god - awful even . i don ' t need to go into plot details , read the other reviews . the jokes make no sense . the acting was terrible . i know it was supposed to be a comedy , but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting . you might try to watch it as something to laugh at , but it ' s so bad that it isn ' t even funny in that way . avoid ! 
NEG portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde ; she likes him too , but not for the reasons you might think . little - seen black comedy from writer pat proft features very good performances by joe alaskey and donna dixon , yet it makes no lasting impact . it ' s just a quickie throwaway effort , helmed by norman bates himself , anthony perkins . even on the level of b - comedies , the somewhat - similar " eating raoul " is a better bet . there ' s definitely an amusing set - up here ; unfortunately , the picture has nowhere to go in its second act . an interesting try , but it misfires . < br / > < br / > * * from * * * * 
NEG i wouldn ' t say this is a * bad * movie . unfortunately for me , i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing , the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic . i ' ve been fencing since i was 14 years old , and this movie portrays it very poorly . f . murray abraham is good ( and appears to have some fencing background ) , but most of the other actors - - especially the students - - just seem to be lost . 
NEG well . this was not a surprise . many people will tell you this is gory . but they are all talking " shiztz " this film is very slow . < br / > < br / > it starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it " my son " there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak . you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening . there is some really stupid scenes in this . and they dub over the hits and slaps with stupid fake slapping sound which makes me laugh ! i would not recommend it . keep looking gore hounds . < br / > < br / > check this out if you want the like 20 - 10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum . . yeah its weird . 
NEG the real irony is this : joe besser was a top notch comedian , in other situations away from the stooges . he had a definite track record for being very funny and clever . moe and larry and shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work . so what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the " third stooge " ? obviously , nothing . in most of these " late stooge " era shorts , more often than not , the boys are pitted against each other or joe against the other two and this is not accurate stooge etiquette . " one for all , all for one , every man for himself " , to quote curly from " restless knights " . one thing about a good comedy team , laurel & hardy , abbott & costello , the marx brothers , no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around , when the chips are actually down , they stick together and come to each other ' s aid . in this particular one , none of that happens . it ' s almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty , and not for comedic effect either . one might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here , art imitates life . maybe there really was hence why besser did not stay very long with moe and larry . just look at the history of the other teams and tell me i ' m wrong . 
NEG miscasting happens . susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre , and her performance is impeccable . however , edward rochester is supposed to be 35 . white - haired george c . scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80 . jane ' s deceased uncle is in better shape ! he creaks and snarls , obnoxious and grim . he looks like an ax - murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened ; we ' re not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic ! the great love story looks like a sado - masochistic nightmare . there is enough darkness in the novel , but bronte ' s rochester is relatively young , athletic , powerful , and charming when he chooses to be . he has a fine speaking and singing voice , a good mind , and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle . 
NEG first a technical review . the script is so slow , it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min . the dialogue is so flat and truly one - dimensional . the " acting " is pathetic , they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board . as for the whole " point " of the story , namely " war is bad " ( oh , there ' s a shock ! ) is really non - existent . without out the " lets shock ' em and get great publicity " scene nobody would be talking about this film . it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on . believe me i ' ve seen some bad " emperor ' s new clothes " films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this ! read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don ' t talk about it . 
NEG good performances can ' t save this terrible script , larded with every cliche in the chick - flick book . both main characters are deeply unsympathetic , and the scene where laura linney ' s character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son - - which i think is supposed to be poignant - - is just horrifying . 
NEG not even goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what gore has done with this complete piece of fiction . this is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say . the " scientists " gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers , psychologists and psychiatrists . would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro - surgery ? the field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support gores alarmist claims of global warming . as one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years i have not seen any evidence to support global warming . my analysis of this movie and gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant . no more , no less . ask any global warming alarmist or " journalist " one simple question - you say global warming is a major problem . tell me . what temperature is the earth supposed to be ? 
NEG not a very good movie but according to the info it ' s pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques . the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the nk pow camps and that ' s done effectively enough , with surprising frankness for the time . whatever technical flaws exist ( and there are plenty ) by watching this you ' ll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again , nasty because it ' s being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo bay . < br / > < br / > i don ' t think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office , and if you watch the movies like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films . i don ' t know if it was the people in ' 54 being trapped in the wwii concepts ( the boys tend to wisecrack a lot ) or the war or what , but it ' s interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like " go tell the spartans " . 
NEG oh dear lord . this movie . . . it was horrible . i am a huge fan of horror movies . and most of the time , horror movies other people say are bad , i like . the actor who played ' scarecrow ' was amazing , i will say that . but this plot was awful . it made no sense ! it had way too much gore , and an unnecessary ( and revolting ) sex scene at the beginning . i do believe the director was trying to be ' shocking ' or whatnot , but it just came out awful . to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot , the actors ( besides ' scarecrow ' ) we ' re awful , and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who . in conclusion , this movie made me sick . if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway , please do . 
NEG this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen . every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors - corey and danny are soo annoying . corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny ' s false promises . < br / > < br / > neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film . danny ( dean paras ) looks in his late thirties and the girl he ' s trying to bed - corey looks as if she ' s still in college . < br / > < br / > here in australia , this film is called too smooth ; there is nothing smooth about this film at all . 1 / 10 avoid 
NEG this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with . the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull , boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr . hartford ' s 8th grade social studies class - - way back in 67 . < br / > < br / > what a waste , will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it . < br / > < br / > every time a scene had potential , all we were left with were a few clichés , combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action . shameful . < br / > < br / > ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest . the other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery . < br / > < br / > however , if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren ' t concerned with being awed or entertained , but want to learn about the uss mason , it is worth a watch . 
NEG it is a real shame that nearly no one under 30 knows the " over the top " writing of michael o ' donoghugh - magazine articles and snl skits that were genius for the time . . . and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos - thus leading them to mr mikes mondo video . < br / > < br / > this movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone . the viewer experiences such things as cat diving / swimming with the man who thinks he ' s found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence . then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired ( hula hops , pet rocks , rainbow dread wigs etc . ) then we enter the music world ( punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film ) where " d " rate bar performer rootboy slim performs " boogie till you puke " in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze . now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music . in many different styles with many different instruments the sound of telstar plays and replays - for those who don ' t understand telstar was the first american satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph . mr mikes seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes . now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of sid vicious ( ex sex pistol not the wrestler ) singing my way . his version is very different than sinatras as one might imagine but frankly i feel it is very much worth the listen . . . it ' s good ! that is the sad part - in the vhs release paul anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1 / 2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol . < br / > < br / > i would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is passé i can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2 . 5 . if you want to see a good o ' donoghugh script watch scrooged . . . it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent . 
NEG i picked this up at the video store because of tarantino ' s recommendation ( " if you don ' t like ( this ) , go f & ^ % yourself ! " ) on the box . . . seemed like a ringing endorsement . . . . i was expecting something a bit more like " death proof " . . . not much actual violence in this one tho , or plot , of character , or dialogue . < br / > < br / > look at the poster . it ' s all there . stunts , and rock . it goes back and forth . a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show , at a level that you ' d maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip , and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet . . . they work , they meet girls , they party . end of story . < br / > < br / > the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second - tier , and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 . it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that aussie fellow really is something , and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the " art " . i hung it there to see what crazy thing he ' d do next . just wish he could have found a better vehicle . 
NEG woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other . this is the case with " melinda and melinda , " where all the characters speak with allen ' s generic pseudo - sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where allen lives . they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi - million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living . < br / > < br / > the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will ferrel as the obligatory woody allen surrogate . although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression ( like kenneth branagh in the god - awful " celebrity " ) , ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies . < br / > < br / > the end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once - great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years . 
NEG i just got back from the film and i ' m completely appalled . this movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind . the theatre i was in maybe had 4 other people . this movie was recommended to me and i couldn ' t believe that this person liked it . i can ' t believe that any sane human would like it . there was no plot no plot at all . it was a joke . how can you make a movie about nothing . this movie only goes to show why hollywood is in such a shambles . i can only just look at the spiral of the " horror movie " industry and giggle . what a travesty to all filmaking , this is true of all the new " teen horror flicks " grudge , boogeyman , ring , saw series . it is all such trash . don ' t support this kind of hogwash ! 
NEG this movie was awful . the ending was absolutely horrible . there was no plot to the movie whatsoever . the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones . their performances were excellent ! the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice . if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story , it would be worth watching . instead , robert duvall ' s and james earl jones ' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline . . . or lack thereof . not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie . . . . well an actual movie . . . not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason . it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time . there was nothing special about any of the characters . the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling , senile , drunk , old man . nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end . when the movie ended , i sat amazed . . . amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while . it never happened ! the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning . it wasn ' t even a story . the entire movie takes place in a day ' s worth of time . that ' s it . it was one day in the life ( and death ) of some southerners on a plantation . how much of a story can take place in a single day ( other than the movie training day ) ? the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent , but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie . . . if you can even call it a movie . 
NEG first of all , if you ' r a fan of the comic , well , you ' ll be very disappointed i ' m sure ! low budget movie ! ! ! largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic , now suddenly he becomes croatian , pfff ! chicken producers , it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( by the way , in the film , his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian . . . lol ) . the striking n . y . winch building becomes a common average - small yacht in h . k . the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan / turkish looking guy . freddy the cool ' scarface ' pilot becomes some fat , out of shape , sad , average guy . simon , largo ' s good buddy , does not exist at all ! ? he gave some pepper ! largo doesn ' t throw knifes at all , but just some snake stares . . . the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv - film . french directors and producers , if you don ' t have the money , the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic , please stick to some romance shooted in paris . very very bad film , good thing i just rented it , don ' t count on me to watch the sequel ( if there is any ! ) . 
NEG imagine the big chill with a cast of twenty - somethings whose characters are all unlikable , and an iguana - like man - lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein . on the positive side , the movie does not skimp on showing the monster . there ' s no peek - a - boo shots , or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like ; he ' s right out there folks . unfortunately , the design and construction aren ' t that inspired . a little bit of mystery might have helped . mind you , i ' ve seen far worse , but if you ' re going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick , your monster better look damn good . < br / > < br / > spoiler ahead ! ! ! < br / > < br / > oh , and there ' s a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . this came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script . as for the acting ; well let ' s just say it wasn ' t painfully bad , but i don ' t expect we ' ll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings . < br / > < br / > gore quotient : 2 out of 5 ; nudity quotient : 1 out of 5 ; intelligence quotient : negligible 
NEG " steve " ( chris hoffman ) gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing . while they are there , a reptilian creature in the shape of a man ( reminded me a lot of the gillman from creature from the black lagoon ) awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one . a biker , ellen ripley - type time female bad - ass , kat ( chase masterson ) has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in , while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage . kat knows more than she ' s telling ( she also suffered the loss of a child ) , but there ' s another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of . this creature might just be more human than they realize . . and it ' s former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since wes ' death . kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin . < br / > < br / > thankfully , a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it ' s eyes . the film has dawson ' s creek - type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie . the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares . the cast is rather life - less and uninteresting . pretty maggie grace ( the fog remake ) might be the only draw for this film . 
NEG okay , as a long time disney fan , i really - hate - direct - to - video disney sequels . walt himself didn ' t believe in them . he believed in " and they lived happily ever after " being the end of it . but this one . . . really ticked the taco . there were so many ripoffs of other disney films in this , it wasn ' t funny . quick summary , if you don ' t already know . . . : melody , the daughter of ariel and prince eric , is born . ursula ' s sister , morganna ( who basically looks like ursula , if she were to dye herself green and go on the ally macbeal starvation diet ) shows up and , after trying to do the newborn tyke in , and failing , prophesizes doom for the characters . after that ordeal , ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father , and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid heritage , and later on , forbids her to go near the sea . well surprise surprise . melody finds out , being the stubborn brat she is , and runs away , then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid , in exchange for something . ( gee does that sound familiar ? ) she becomes one , but in her half of the bargain , has to retrieve her granddaddy ' s trident and bring it back to the sea witch . while doing this , she runs into a couple of outcast animals , a penguin and a walrus named timon and pumb - - huh ? wait . . . no ! that ' s not timon and pumbaa ! or is it ? could of fooled me . anyway , i ' d like to reveal more , but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does . ok so . . . long story short . this movie " borrows " too much from other ( better ) disney films . . . and does it horribly . come on . . . tip and dash ? why not just make dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff ! ugh . not to mention , the total character butchery of ariel ' s persona . she ' s gone from being a freespirited , headstrong woman , to a clone of her father . not good at all . . . they ' re basically telling us the sweet , firey little mermaid we ' ve known to grow and love is dead . plus melody herself isn ' t such a great character either . . . she ' s damned annoying ! and bratty ! not to mention what they ' ve done to flounder . ugh . . . anyway if you decide to see this piece of created - mainly - for - profit - reasons , no - imagination , eisner - sponsored c * * * * * * t , i suggest maybe waiting ' till its on the disney channel or some other tv station . because , it ' s not even worth the price of a rental . < br / > < br / > * out of * * * * * stars . 
NEG okay . . . so i ' ve seen a lot of really odd / unusual movies in my day . fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that . well not anymore . . . from here on out , whenever someone asks me , " hey , what ' s the most unusual movie you ' ve ever seen ? " slipstream is what i ' ll say ! and i do not mean " unusual " in a good way . < br / > < br / > from the very beginning of the movie , it was obvious that this was going to be one of those " trippy camera effect " movies . by that i mean , little things like flashing images on the screen , rewinding and fast - forwarding people ' s words and scenes , messing with the color on the screen , flash forwards and flash backs constantly . . . then you have the actual acting itself . people randomly get violent , shoot things / people , say the weirdest things that just don ' t make much , if any sense . < br / > < br / > the movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he ' s writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it , you basically see this " trip " he goes on throughout the movie . the thing is , johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch , not painful ! honestly , i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream . it kind of hurt my brain a bit . < br / > < br / > i can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia . . . blah , blah , blah . point is , this movie hurts your brain when you watch it . . . . it makes very little sense , it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end , the only thing you can be happy about is that it ' s over . . . and you can say you actually sat through it ! so in closing , if you want to see a movie that will have you saying " what the heck " over and over again both out loud and in your head , go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out . < br / > < br / > mr hopkins , while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing . . . . please , do not ever make a movie like this again . next time , try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache . 
NEG why did i waste 1 . 5 hours of my life watching this ? why was this film even made ? why am i even commenting on this film ? < br / > < br / > one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n ' t for everybody . i cannot figure out who this movie is for . maybe after dropping a hit of acid , somebody , somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it . it is incoherent , it isn ' t experimental , it ' s plain and simple garbage . the film follows no plot line whatsoever , just when you think you have something , well . . . . . you don ' t . < br / > < br / > i think the ending brought some finality to the film ( no pun intended ) , the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on . i don ' t think i put a spoiler in here , not that it would matter . this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom . 
NEG this sci - fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst . i agree with the statement that bad sci - fi is comical . bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late , late , late show viewers . space explorers on the planet mars fight off strange giant amoeba - like monsters and other strange creatures . pretty cool . < br / > < br / > the cast includes les tremayne , naura hayden , gerald mohr and jack kruschen . get comfy and enjoy . don ' t feel bad if you nod off for a moment . i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss . 
NEG the 1990 ' s begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right . every network had one , and they all lacked one thing originality . ricky lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless , illiterate children . the english language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence . titltes ranging from girl you a pigeon head and so on . how could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage ? has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy ' s and dead beat fathers ? the people who appear on this show were trash . the people who watched this show were trash . anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto dvd is trash . people wonder why americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs , its having shows like this tell them its ok to be 500lbs overweight , and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes . having such trash on tv has ruined morals . 
NEG if you ' re watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about , then you ' re in for quite the surprise . even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline , but the actual film is anything but . < br / > < br / > as the synopsis went , it tells of an obsessed mountain climber , which you ' ll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl , which tells you of the presence of chronopolis , an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind ( note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights ) , where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence . they can see our world , and notice of all persons this mountain climber , and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy , creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man . < br / > < br / > what that translated to , is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce . have shapes created , though credit goes to the stop motion style , and put it through a mind - numbing loop . and repeat until your eyes start to close , then move on to the next scene . if anything , the chonopolisians ( if this term exists ) really love their sticks and balls , constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere , and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the " other " world . it gets no better as well , when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence . < br / > < br / > thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what ' s advertised , which is 57 minutes ( or less ) against the 70 stated . while firmly dated , its dull colours , non - existent story , scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans . don ' t waste time . 
NEG my girlfriend picked this one ; as a southern born and raised african american i found this movie ' s plot and premise totally without credibility . to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante - bellum south . totally absurd ! ! ! i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell ( who being southern knows better ) to participate in this crap 
NEG this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date , the best part was christian j . meoli " leonard " attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar , kind - of like i wanted to do on the dvd , to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film . it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good , i mean with sean astin " andrew " ( played his part perfectly , did a great job , too bad it was in this film ) , kyra sedgwick " bevan " , ron livingston " chad " , renée zellweger " poet " ( they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie . . . < br / > < br / > if the cast had any dignity , they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer / director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom 
NEG ( avast , slight spoilers ahead ) i got this tape from my local library , which keeps a copy for obvious reasons . < br / > < br / > i once went to the town of matewan , west virginia , and in a little museum there i saw the schedule for the town theatre citra may 1954 . movies would change at the theatre each day . as there would be no tv for another decade or so in those parts , this was much of the available entertainment in the town . " the raid " seems to have been made for towns like matewan in the 1950 ' s . although it wasn ' t listed for that month , i am sure showed there some monday or tuesday night for an audience which probably wasn ' t too demanding . the historical raid - daring and remarkably successful - didn ' t seem to have been very well researched , so the movie is full of hollywood embellishments , including a loose cannon played by lee marvin . marvin uses the opportunity to practice being liberty valance . and st . albans seems to have had more yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than washington d . c . had . < br / > < br / > what really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their confederate uniforms . only in tacky civil war paintings do rebel uniforms look so pristine . when anne bancroft ' s son catches van heflin in his uniform just before the raid , i expected the boy to think it was halloween . < br / > < br / > and then there ' s anne bancroft herself . while watching the movie i actually looked on the imdb to see if there was a second anne bancroft . the then - studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films , and has none of the presence she would later have in " the miracle worker , " " agnes of god , " and of course " the graduate . " < br / > < br / > worth seeing if only 1 ) . you live in st . albans and 2 ) . you have a couple hours to kill on a hollywood fictionalization of your home town ' s biggest news story . 
NEG i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home , because i had packed away all their toys . ( toddlers don ' t like to watch " regis and kathie lee " or " the view . " ) my four year old found one scene funny , but told me the rest of it was " too silly . " this is a four year old , folks . anyone over the age of , say , nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out . < br / > < br / > to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake . there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this " film " truly is . the acting is bad , the plot is stupid , and the script is pathetically unfunny . since this is supposed to be a comedy , the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse . bronson " balki " pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent ( irish - pakistani - bronx - cockney - cajun as far as i could tell ) , but all the characters are awful . i haven ' t watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages , but i know that they had to be way better than this . what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with . . . this ? < br / > < br / > bottom line : derivative garbage . avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish . 2 / 10 
NEG please don ' t hate me but i have to be honest , watching this movie , i had a lot of fun , , < br / > < br / > it ' s a movie with a stupid cast and stupid songs ! ! ! < br / > < br / > unnecessary songs ! ! ! mehbooba . . . a total insult to the original one holi . . . . well . . it was ok ! due to the tradition every movie got to have one ! ! chad raha hai nasha whatever . . . very unneeded stupid song jee le . . . sounded like a playboy song stupid song . . . < br / > < br / > other than songs . the movie was ok this was ram gopal verma ' s own adaptation . . . if you think like that you will like this movie < br / > < br / > well this movie only depends on the viewer and on his judgement whether he / she thinks this movie is total copy he / she would want to hit her head on the cinema seat or if he / she thinks of the directors own look he / she would be relaxed and take a look at this movie < br / > < br / > anyways i looked at both ways i would congratulate and abuse ram gopal for this disaster that he made . . . < br / > < br / > well some other things that bothered that the cast was incredibly bad < br / > < br / > amitabh bachchan as babban / gabbar ( amitabh in his own movie remake funny what was the director thinking ) ajay devgan as heero / veeru ( bobby deol could have been better ) prashant raj as raj / jai ( abhishek was meant for this role despite doing a special appearance in the mehbooba song ) sushmita sen as radha / durga ( jaya bachchan was right tabu was right for this role ) nisha kothari as ghungroo / basanti ( i think esha deol would have been great ) mohanlal as narishma / thakur ( mohanlal is so cute . . . . oops sorry hehehehe , he was ok i could not think of anyone ) < br / > < br / > the movie would have even faired a little if the cast was ok < br / > < br / > i movie wasn ' t even exciting , the movie was just ok , just for watching < br / > < br / > the overall rating < br / > < br / > direction . . . 8 / 10 i got to him some credit cinematography . . . 9 / 10 script . . . 3 / 10 bad scripting songs . . . 5 / 10 unnecessary in the movie , could have been better , easy on the ears on to be played in pc ' s and ipod ' s and stuff cast . . . 1 / 10 < br / > < br / > total . . . 3 / 10 < br / > < br / > syed shabbir aly naqvi from pakistan 
NEG the first look on the cover of this picture , it looks like a good rock n roll movie . but don ' t let the cover fool you , or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it . the storyline is just horrible , and so is the acting . plain and simple : bad < br / > < br / > it ' s not a movie about a roadie , its just a thin love story , so awful that you see right through it . the only good thing about this movie , is the soundtrack . some good songs , and that is why i give 2 out of 10 . if it wasn ' t for the music , it would of been 0 out of 10 . meat loaf is a horrible actor ( at least he was in 1980 ) , and the girl who plays the groupie isn ' t even good looking ! this movie was a huge disappointment for me , because it makes a lot of good promises . 
NEG it ' s so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows , as superficial and brutal as the " garcea " series or the " vacanta mare " child - plays . . . the difference is that mugur mihäescu , doru octavian dumitru and other such sub - artisans never presume to claim their shows as " art " . pintilie , who 40 years ago made a very good movie ( " duminicä la ora sase " ) followed by another one , nice enough ( " reconstituirea " ) , tries to declare his film - lenghts " art works " - but , unfortunately , he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression . as such , " niki ardelean " offers again a sample of " how not " - this being about its only merit . 
NEG this should be re - titled " the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non - horror snorer as a shock film . " it ' s one long , boring tale of a fraternity hazing , a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it . jeff east , an actor in the dues - paying stage , can be forgiven for taking any work he could get . the same can ' t be said for charles martin smith , who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah . once available on tape but , thankfully , not out on dvd . misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else . 
NEG there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film . there ' s not one scary , funny , or even interesting scene in this film . it advertises itself as a horror , then goes on to call itself a comedy . it doesn ' t even attempt humor . neither does it attempt to be scary . < br / > < br / > in order to not be bored by this film , you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth . if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all . i ' m having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this . its not funny , scary , shocking , or intriguing . so was it supposed to be a drama ? because it really wasn ' t dramatic either . < br / > < br / > please just do yourself a favor and don ' t watch this film . life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this . 
NEG i actually had hopes for this movie since i ' ve seen kari in a few other things and think she has some talent . alas , this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay . completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability , and no plot whatsoever . is it a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama ? the filmmakers don ' t have a clue , and neither do we . 
NEG crazed shotgun toting - incest driven - revenge seeking truck drivers & obsessive control disorder " daddy raped me when i was 12 " handcuff carrying , all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station ( ie : skinemax ) at 4am on sunday nights . ( and yes i know that was an entire sentence , but bare with me people ; this is a long - winded review for a short pointless film ) . < br / > < br / > filmed in " somewhere " canada , with almost no budget , the plot to this freak show is trite , the police in it obviously never heard of " state jurisdiction " because they end up chasing both miya ( hookers ) and trent ( idiotic , anal retentive , generic , insecure college student ) all across the u . s . ( and i thought only the fbi could do that ) . the camera is shaky , the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like " ishtar " and " leonard part 6 " . < br / > < br / > as far as the skin scenes go ( which is the only reason to even rent this movie , don ' t even think of buying it ) there are two of them . the first one is the only one worth watching though which is the dominatrix sex scene with kari salin and ____ ( insert unknown actor here , he ' s obviously done nothing else worth noting ) in a seedy , disgusting motel room ( the kind with the busted sink that drips , and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it ) . it ' s all s & m ( riding crops , handcuffs , hot wax , and underwear licking ) folks and in the end , he gets left in a motel room , with no money and cops waiting at his door ( that ' s goes to show you guys , don ' t let a hooker tie you up in a " middle - of - nowhere " motel room ) . sadly though , kari shows no skin worth remembering , and that alone can cause deep - seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen , so that is definitely a downer towards this flick . < br / > < br / > as for the ending , * snicker * snicker * i know you probably wouldn ' t mind if i revealed it to you but i won ' t , you should spend your hard earned money for that one . all in all i give it a 1 / 5 for action , a 3 / 5 for skin ( see last paragraph ) and a 0 / 0 for acting , character development or intricate plot twists . < br / > < br / > - laughing man 
NEG 1993 was the year . this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar . who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him ? i was actually a paid extra in " my boyfriend ' s back , " which was shot in a suburb of austin called georgetown , tx . the original title was " johnny zombie " ( thank god the producers had a change of heart ! ) i was in the theater scene . i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters . it is more of a comedy than a horror movie . but . . . for a good laugh , you might want to check it out . nothing that is even close to " dawn of the dead " or even " shaun of the dead " quality , but the cheese factor is good enough . ciao 
NEG when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider , are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way ? this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society . when a comedian / actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves ( do i want to support that behavior ) ? in this case mr . foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong , good behavior from bad that loving - kindness is better than hatefulness . mr . foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from . saying sorry does not get him off the hook . it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth . one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it . no longer see anything they are part of . we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them . 
NEG for romantic comedies , i often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience . unfortunately for " the wedding date , " i can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears . < br / > < br / > my apologies to fans of debra messing and dermot mulroney , but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters . the premise of the film is a reverse " pretty woman , " with dermot playing the role of nick , a high - priced male escort hired by debra ' s character kat to accompany her to england for her sister ' s wedding . a romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client . but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial . and there weren ' t enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and kat . < br / > < br / > in a supporting role , amy adams was a standout as kat ' s sister . whenever amy came on screen , she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film ' s energy . perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of kat , the film might have had more dynamism . but as it turned out , instead of reaching for kleenex , i was looking for the visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance . 
NEG i went to see this movie with my 17 y . o . daughter . i insisted we go the matinée showing , not because i ' m a tightwad , but just feeling i had . in the nascar spirit , this is a sponser ' s dream . so much blatant advertising , it almost qualifies as an info - mercial , if it weren ' t for the so - called acting . keeping with tradition , the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines , the car is only a ' vehicle ' ( no pun intended ) for this cornball of a motion picture . earlier herbie installments ( although cheesy as well ) were produced during more serious times , making them a little easier to digest . ms . lohan , disney ' s reigning drama queen , has little acting ability . i was surprised that mr . keaton and mr . dillon would get involved in such a project . only the snack bar , was a bigger ripoff ! 
NEG ohhh the brutality , ohhhhh the dying breed , ohhhh the sense of loss , ohhhh the prejudice ! jeez , when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud ? s * * t happens . if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection . < br / > < br / > boring , tedious , and very tiresome waste of celluloid - particularly in light of coburn / hackman / bergen ' s presence . nothing interesting or intriguing here , unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty . may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out - of - place mexican guy with the bad tooth . a monument to the stupid ultra - left creeping sensitivity of the 60 / 70 ' s . virtually impossible to sit through the entire film . i think i ' d rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky luke / trinity series . 4 horses / 10 - all deader ' n hell . 
NEG don ' t expect much from this film . in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in 1956 , title , julie . in this film doris , who was a flight attendant , stewardess , in those days , landed the air craft after her derange husband , played by louis jordan shot the captain . she did a far better job , more convincing , than kim ojah , who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower . i know a little about 747 aircraft , i use to be a flight attendant myself . like i said , do not expect much from this film , it was done on a cheap budget . the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it . oceanic is one name that several movies have used . the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft . 
NEG from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing i ' ve ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically 
NEG normally , i don ' t like revenge films . . . . period . but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise . you see , di has action , accuracy , exotic locales ( i . e . hong kong ) , awesome gun battles , and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat . like all revenge flicks , it has villains you ' d love to throw out of a plate - glass window on the top floor of a 40 - story building ! however , double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist , racist , and venomous social stereotypes that invaded " eye for an eye " and " death wish 2 " . < br / > < br / > but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap . chad and alex ' s parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that ' s what i remembered . the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one . it wasn ' t the watery plot that made this movie bad , but the use of clichéd lines and moves from other movies ( from lethal weapon to the princess bride ) really made it worse . but nonetheless double impact is still watchable . but why is that shitty movies like this have villains ( for example , that greedy british guy that killed chad and alex ' s parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick ) you would love to hate with fiber of your being ? 
NEG i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this " horror " movie . i did not get scared even once while watching it . it also is not very suspenseful either . . . . i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie . . . so . . what ' s left ? < br / > < br / > " the ring " is a trully scary movie . . . i wish other movies would stop copying from it ( e . g . the trade - mark : long hair ) . please give me some originality . < br / > < br / > will not recommend this movie . 
NEG this superior inferiority to the original dumb " blind dead " movie is another trash bin waste . so many people have hyped up these films that i can ' t believe what they say about it . since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed , was everyone on drugs , from the 1970 ' s or do they just not know how boring this crude is ? 
NEG i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard . and , in addition to them , charles butterworth ( a very enjoyable supporting actor ) was in this film , . . . so why didn ' t i particularly enjoy it ? ! well , despite a good cast , this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd " a pictures " i have ever seen . given the talent and money spent to make this film , it is shocking how slip - shod the writing was . i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next - - and i was always right ! and this isn ' t because i am some sort of " movie savant " , but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it . in fact , it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together ! also , i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet , true to convention , she came running to him in the end . uggh ! there is more suspense in a lassie film ( " will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break ? " ) . < br / > < br / > despite the very , very tired and clichéd script , there were a few positives about the film . it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film - - it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn ' t eaten , shaved or slept in days . also , charles butterworth ' s " prattle " did provide a few mildly humorous moments . but all this just wasn ' t enough to make this film look any different than a " b movie " . it ' s a shame , . . . it could have been so much better . 
NEG i hated the way ms . perez portrayed puerto ricans ! we are not all ghetto - and we do speak spanish - not puerto rican ! i can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into . but our language is intact , our island is our pride . puerto rico is better off economically than any other caribbean island ! i ' m glad we are not like cuba , dominican republic or haiti , free from american influence ? free in true poverty , not the u . s . standard of poverty . we are not victims we are resilient , humble , honest and intelligent people . our ancestry does include strong african roots , but not " black " roots - i have nothing in common with black americans 9do the research ) . < br / > < br / > the analogy between pedro albizu , che guevarra and martin l . king could not be more off the mark . < br / > < br / > mlk was a great hero a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free . < br / > < br / > che guevarra helped castro create the cuba that is today , is that why boat fulls of cubans risk their lives to come to america - because che made such a better place for them ? you had a great , awesome , bright idea but you politicized it too much . we have so many things to be proud of as a people - don ' t bring shame to our people by victimizing us . i am not a nuyorican and perhaps that is why i can ' t share your views . i am puerto rican , i speak spanish , i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america . if there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph - there are many . < br / > < br / > damaris maldonado 
NEG . . . except for jon heder . this guy tanked the entire movie . < br / > < br / > the plot sounded entertaining . a 29 year old slacker son ( heder ) still lives with widowed mom ( keaton ) who happens to meet a new love ( daniels ) . slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship . he also meets a girl ( faris ) . < br / > < br / > i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach . heders performance is annoying , which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy , problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale . at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you ' re upset about the end . in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me ! 
NEG what the . . . . . . . . . . . is this ? this must , without a doubt , be the biggest waste of film , settings and camera ever . i know you can ' t set your expectations for an 80 ' s slasher high , but this is too stupid to be true . i baught this film for 0 . 89 $ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back . can you imagine who hard it stinks ? < br / > < br / > who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations ? ? ? well actually , you couldn ' t possible care less . and why should you ? the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn ' t care . they didn ' t try to create a tiny bit of tension . the director ( stephen carpenter - - i guess it ' s much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the kindred ( 1986 ) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors . complete crap as well , but at least that one had eliza dushku . this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga ! ! ! ( who ? ? ) yeah that ' s right , the melrose place chick . her very memorable character dies about 15 min . after the opening credits . she ' s the second person to die . the first victim dies directly in the first minute , but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? the rest of the actors . . . they don ' t deserve the term actors actually , are completely uninteresting . you ' re hoping they die a quick and painful death . . . and not only their characters < br / > < br / > my humble opinion = 0 / 10 
NEG i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk . the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species . their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized . everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure ; or they have a fascination with chickens . they are on the make or beating each other up . it ' s as if the scriptwriter said , what can i make up for them to do , without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is . watch the wonderful human portrayal in " one flew over the cuckoo ' s nest " where the illnesses are believable and real . i once worked in a state mental hospital . i didn ' t see any of these guys . these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life . 
NEG dr tarr ' s torture dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients . however , the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be , and the asylum is being run by the patients , and the doctors are in cages . first of all , some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep , and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons ( a guy who thinks he ' s a chicken , for instance ) . i have to admit that the story is actually pretty good , but the film itself bombs . the music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy , and yes , there is a scene involving dancing chicken men , which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen . watch this film at your own risk ! < br / > < br / > rated : r for violence and nudity . 
NEG without a doubt one of the worst movies i ' ve seen in recent years . the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with . it ' s tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions . oh no , the cops are on to us , they know who we are , what do we do ? . . . let ' s rob one more bank then we ' re outta here ! what ! ? ! every character is a stereotype and it ' s easy to tell who ' s gonna end up dead . 
NEG avoid this one , unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie . example ? the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a french film . < br / > < br / > this film attempts to combine western , drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic . what ? well , consider this . the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights . or how about the woman in her underwear , holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed ? < br / > < br / > someone should do a ' what ' s up tiger lily ' on this bomb . rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it . heck , it ' s almost that now . ( btw , gerard depardieu and carole bouquet , both known to american audiences , have roles . ) 
NEG now , it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title , so i ' ll wait on that . first , this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles . then i realized it , this is a movie with a message , that message is beat kids and things like this won ' t happen . things like what you ask ? things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical " kill the monster indirectly " fashion . now , as promised . . . blue monkey . . . has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind . now it snot like i was cheated or anything . the picture on the cover had a giant bug / crab / idiot / thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses . that kinda happened but i wanted apes ! having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before ( half drunk on cask and creame ' s brandy mind you ) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80 ' s style . not so much . if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you . if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids , rent this . 
NEG all this dismaying waste of film stock needs is count floyd popping up every sixty seconds . somehow they got steve railsback , susan anspach , john vernon , and joe flaherty together on a set and couldn ' t get within five miles , about eight kilometers , of an actual movie . boy does this thing suck . there isn ' t one original line , thought , shot , or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close . the magical , ethereal susan anspach of five easy pieces - boring . steve railsback - boring . john vernon - boring . the big bug - boring . if this is a scary movie , buttercream gang is a thuglife documentary . < br / > < br / > seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness . usually it ' s in the opening credits - " written , directed , and produced by " one guy . or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there ' s one and only one reason this turkey got made . here , you don ' t find out till the very last of the credits , where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the canadian government is gratefully acknowledged . < br / > < br / > right now i ' m watching mst ' s take on beast of yucca flats to get the taste out of my mouth . ghod , what an improvement . 
NEG what the hell is this ? its one of the dumbest movies i ' ve seen . i don ' t understand why people on this site love it so much . its senseless & nudity for no reason . its worst then resident evil . i strongly don ' t recomend it unless you want to watch chessy , bad acting crap . watch real horor movies such as stephen king ' s it , the shining , jurassic park ( kinda horor ) , jaws , etc . leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent . it is bad as crudy vs gayson . attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this crap . < br / > < br / > oh wow flesh eating zombies . how many damn zobie movies do we need . skip this one . < br / > < br / > * outta * * * * 
NEG ah yes the 1980s , a time of reaganomics and sly , chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . at the time i couldn ` t believe how movies like rambo , missing in action and uncommon valor ( and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn ? ) made money at the box office , they ` re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . troma ` s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you ` ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? of course not . troma ` s war lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there ` s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . maybe it is ? 
NEG how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film . tina still looked fit and attractive , but for some reason seems truly frightened . i can understand her fear ; fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public . also , i ' m a fan of the likable adam west . again , as with tina , adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age . his acting here is passable , but the script is so bad , that it ' s difficult to even listen to the dialog . < br / > < br / > the movie is a rip - off of the classic brando biker flick , the wild ones ; out - law biker gang is out - of - control in a small hick - town . the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn ' t want them to date my sister . the acting is stiff and wooden , and the story - plot is as old as sand . hellriders is hell to watch ! 
NEG okay the promos promised a comedy and people ( few ) went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing , or for that matter of any year , because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some more < br / > < br / > okay coming to jawani diwani < br / > < br / > review in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it ' s annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina jaitley < br / > < br / > cringeworthy dialogues , comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholes < br / > < br / > direction is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here , luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost it ' s touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible 
NEG five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up . but is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye ? < br / > < br / > lucky me , five bad movies for the price of one ! each segment features the very worst in acting , special effects , make up and music . and these were supposed to be scary ? hmm . . i think i ' ve been more freaked out during an episode of teletubbies . i swear , you ' ll sit there like i was , bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen . don ' t bother . it never does . in fact , i even stopped fast forwarding the commercials , as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature . and the ending is the ultimate cop - out . yep , none of this actually ever happened . if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this cobblers . . 2 / 10 
NEG boy oh boy oh golly gee , < br / > < br / > the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom ' s " invisibility . " they looked like they were shot on cheap video , and it looks totally unreal , and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie . . . < br / > < br / > i did not end up loving this movie . the attempted " steadicam " shots were really pathetic as well . i mean , hey , if they had a low budget flick , that ' s fine . you can still make a great movie with a low budget . but , a bad movie and a low budget and effects . that makes for a bad combination . in this case , such a doomed combo created the craptastic film , " invisible mom . " if you have kids , and your kids have no taste , perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one . 
NEG this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it , there is a sense of deja vu , don ' t be surprised . all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant . and it doesn ' t get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with . it never works . and like its predecessors , the acting is mediocre . < br / > < br / > the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn ' t fit the story . had this movie ended ten minutes earlier , it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile . but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught . i never like this message resulting from a movie . 
NEG race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you ' ve driven 150 , and 150 mph seems fast till you ' ve driven 250 . < br / > < br / > ok . < br / > < br / > andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you ' ve seen eraserhead , and eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you ' ve seen begotten . < br / > < br / > and begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you ' ve seen the works of c . frederic hobbs . race fans , there is nothing in all the world of film like the works of c . frederic hobbs . < br / > < br / > alabama ' s ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot , and it only involves hippies , rock concerts , voodoo , ghosts , vampires , robots , magicians , corrupt multinational corporations , elephants and mystery gas . and the fabulous woodmobile , cruising the sunset district in san francisco , of course . < br / > < br / > what ' s really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money to make alabama ' s ghost . there ' s sets , lighting , hundreds of extras , costumes , lots and lots of effects . somehow that makes alabama ' s ghost so wrong . you watch some awful cheeseball like night of horror or plutonium baby , and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their discover cards . but alabama ' s ghost was made with an actual budget , and that ' s evil . i mean , i ' ve got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in thunder bay , ontario , building a secret temple in the woods out of twizzlers , and nobody ' s beating down my door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for four of the flakiest movies ever made ? 
NEG the story and the show were good , but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies . ri ' chard is great . he really put on a top notch performance , and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous . seriously , i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile . i can ' t say anything bad about peter galleghar . he ' s one of my favorite actors . i love anne rice . i ' m currently reading the vampire chronicles , but i ' m glad i saw the movie before reading the book . this is a little too " real " for me . i prefer lestat and louis ' s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves . eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me ; i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show . ( sorry for the ambiguity , but i don ' t want to give anything away ) sorry , but it ' s just not my type of show . 
NEG i ' m sorry to say that there isn ' t really any way , in my opinion , that an enzo would really be able to keep up with a saleen s7 twin turbo . the power to weight advantage possessed by the s7 would just be too great . the s7 has a power : weight ratio of 3 . 93 lbs / hp while the enzo has 4 . 61 lbs / hp . the s7s low end is much better too . sorry ferrari fans but the saleen just gets it done so much better . < br / > < br / > as for other parts of this film , i just have to say it ' s so substandard as to be pathetic . the story is way too weak . the acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps . < br / > < br / > i can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem . this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about . its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too . < br / > < br / > i can ' t give the film a " 1 star " rating because it didn ' t compel me to actually walk out of the theater . i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal . . . . although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of ' variety ' . < br / > < br / > ps : the guy who plays jason is sooooo the skid row version of james vanderbeek . 
NEG this is a movie of tired , yet weirdly childish , clichés . there ' s a nazi witch master performing sf - related experiments in the basement ? oh please ! < br / > < br / > aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear , the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright . not having any expectations beforehand , i am left with : an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape - like face who doesn ' t seem to know how to act . said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable " cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death " . < br / > < br / > camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame . 
NEG im proud to say i ' ve seen all three fast and furious films . sure , the plots are kinda silly , and they might be a little cheesy , but i love them car chases , and all the beautiful cars , and the clandestine midnight races . and ill gladly see a fourth one . < br / > < br / > wanna know what the difference is between those three and redline ? decent acting , somewhat thought out plot , even if they are potboilers , and last but not least , directors who have a clue . all three were made by very competent directors , all of them took the films in a different direction , equally exciting . redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch , and made them the extras , then picked up his leads from hollywood ' s unemployment line . and the script . yikes . its mystery science theatre 3000 bad . this is 70 ' s made for tv movie bad . < br / > < br / > yeah , the movie had a few cool cars , but you don ' t really get to see that many in action , and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases , and if the cars aren ' t thrilling you , why go to a movie like this ? < br / > < br / > im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers , and i cant stop laughing out loud . im getting dirty looks , but this was just a debacle . < br / > < br / > rent the f & f movies . go to nascar race . go to a karting track and race yourself . whatever you do , avoid redline like bad cheese . 
NEG well - when the cameo appearance of jason miller ( looking even more eroded than he did in exorcist iv ) is the high point of a picture , what ' ve you got ? < br / > < br / > it ' s a little bit country , a little bit rock n ' roll : mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog - dried mummy ( have you figured that one out yet - dried in a bog ? ) in the basement , christopher walken with a bad dye job , and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they ' d developed her . < br / > < br / > i understand - sort of - that they ' re going back to visit her relatives . after that . . . . < br / > < br / > problem : there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing ( i think ) . this is never connected to anything . < br / > < br / > problem : what do we need the grandmother for ? now , the grandmother could be interesting . she speaks gaelic , or celtic , or something . maybe you can make something of her . the best they can do is that she ' s got a tobacco habit . that ' s all . < br / > < br / > problem : they cast a real shifty character as the husband . is he type - cast ( will he sell his wife to the devil ? maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her ) or is he cast against type ( after all , he has a good haircut and nice clothes ) ? he drinks , he hesitates . he ' s not a bad guy . not a good one . but dislikable . why didn ' t they do something with him ? < br / > < br / > no problem : an old boyfriend shows up . the husband knocks him down . he comes back to knock down the husband . ( it gets pretty stupid , but at least that character has motivation . ) < br / > < br / > now - she ' s an alcoholic , he ' s an alcoholic ; he might only have married her for her money . the grandmother is locked in the bedroom . the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch ( are you following this ? ) who may come to life . in fact , you know she ' ll come to life , the music swells . a little girl lives in the house , takes tea to the grandmother ( unlocks the door to do so ) and provides granny with cigarettes . periodically , granny gets out . but nothing happens . < br / > < br / > husband and wife lose the kid in the house , subsequently lose their bedroom . uncle gets his throat cut in the basement . the leading lady has nose - bleeds . the husband drinks . they both drink . in the face of all of this , the awful truth alluded to in the first over - voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old . < br / > < br / > in spite of all these dangling - thread ingredients , nobody managed to get a story on the screen . no bridge between situations , no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror , just long slow scenes that go nowhere . ; nbody , really , to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks , the grandmother who might be locked up because she ' s a monster , but no , her worst fault is smoking . she ' s got great hair , good makeup . < br / > < br / > in short , no plot . just a little random ( predictable ) violence in a dark library , with the rain gushing in , and the sound track cuing us in . you need more than a few drunks and christopher walken to make a movie . < br / > < br / > the production values were good . oh . nice scenery , good wardrobe . the cameraman , at least , knew what he was doing . < br / > < br / > i bought it . poor me . 
NEG < br / > < br / > upon concluding my viewing of " trance , " or " the eternal , " or whatever the producers are calling this film , i wondered to myself , " out of all of the bad movies i could have seen , couldn ' t i have at least seen one that was entertaining ? " even if a film is not well made in terms of acting , directing , writing , or what have you , it can at least be fun , and therefore worthwhile . but not only is this film bad in artistic value , it ' s incredibly boring . for a plot of such thinness , it moves awfully slowly , with little dramatic tension . at the very least , in a low - brow attempt at entertainment , the deaths of the characters could have been cool and / or gory , but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well . < br / > < br / > what does this movie have going for it ? pretty much nothing , unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken , who is capable of being brilliant , put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self - parody mode ( why did he decide to do this film anyway ? ) . < br / > < br / > i give this film 3 / 10 , because , god help us , there actually have been worse movies made before . 
NEG this wasn ' t really a very good movie . there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film . . . but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience . this movie was produced by magic johnson ! isn ' t that enough to inspire us all to check out this film ? a film produced by a former nba star doesn ' t come along every day , you know . beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho . every cliché trotted out for us to groan over . teen sex . and it was all produced by magic johnson ! i can ' t say enough about this movie ! teen drug use ! college hijinx ! and it was all produced by magic johnson ! yippeeee ! 
NEG i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend , and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie . . . any movie . and since the only movie we ' d not seen was inspector gadget , we decided to go in for that . < br / > < br / > big mistake . this is a movie that might appeal only to kids . oh , and it ' s not like i don ' t enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience . but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention . if you have nothing to do at home , go to sleep . better than wasting hard - earned cash on this . go check out the film if you ' re a kid or if you ' re a parent with a kid : ) 
NEG this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible . obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny . what is it with the talking car with buttons that say wendy ' s , mcdonalds , m & m ' s and skittles ? there was no talking car in the cartoon . ( dr . ) claw is supposed to be evil , not handsome and charming . why is rupert everet ' claw ' anyway ? were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes ? it looks like they were ( badly ) lampooning robo cop , with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing . i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie , you don ' t get a refund . i ' m sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap . after i was told the no - refund policy , i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget . 
NEG i grew up watching inspector gadget . it was , and still is , one of my favorite cartoons , if not my absolute favorite . i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin - off inspector gadget ' s field trip . i wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever . < br / > < br / > but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon . < br / > < br / > matthew broderick , an actor with potential , was definitely not the role for inspector gadget . first thing - in the film , inspector gadget is smart . not so in the cartoon . in the film , gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself . in the cartoon , it was almost always penny , brain , and the awesome book ( i still want her book ! ) . if gadget solved the mystery , it was by accident . gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective , but in the cartoon was pretty dumb , which was where the humor came from . < br / > < br / > another thing is that it ' s too much " good guy v . bad guy " in the film . it ' s not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon . also , gadget never should have a love story , but disney corporation is filled with idiots . < br / > < br / > also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had , and especially the gadget car . in the movie it was a chic convertible . in the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van . it also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place . < br / > < br / > but if anything , the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie . inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon . the movie was too serious , too overdone , had too much of a plot and wasn ' t even remotely as funny . < br / > < br / > tip for those who haven ' t seen it : never see it . ever . watch the cartoon , it ' s a true classic . 
NEG i love westerns . i could watch them all day . " the good , the bad , and the ugly " is my all time favorite . i watched " silverado " for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt . however , this movie , shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched . the acting was terrible all around . they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing . the only good part i can think of is the good - looking cantina girl . the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length . this movie wasn ' t even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store . i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing . only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end . i turned it off half way through because it was so bad . to the director , please do a better job if you decide to make another . this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns . 
NEG . . . . cause it ' s crap ! the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say " why ? " . horrible camera work . . . count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can ' t . the dialog is ridiculous . the acting is comical . it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible . i ' d bet $ 10 they used home video cameras to make this . either that , or most of the cameramen were drunk . truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie . if you ever want to host a " worst movie party " , bring this one . want more entertainment . . . stare at a wall . 
NEG my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes , roughly after the tv report scene , which i couldn ' t handle . it went approximately like this : < br / > < br / > reporter 1 : hmm , there ' s a pyramid in our skies . reporter 2 : i think it ' s aliens . * awkward silence * reporter 1 : in other news . . . < br / > < br / > a few days later i watched it to the end , and it wasn ' t as horrible as i ' ve imagined , but there are serious problems with this . about half of the plot can be easily discarded . and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something . < br / > < br / > what use are the detective , the eugenics people , and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus ? more amusing was the monopoly scene . " we ' re all powerful " gods " , who have lived for aeons , and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly . " monopoly ? monopoly ? ! even erich von dainiken looks coherent , compared to that . < br / > < br / > the other half is terribly lacking . what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo - frozen ? why was there no big event when he was released at the end ? he had those pesky followers , remember ? what happened to normal humans ? what ' s the deal with the masked guy ? how did the blue - haired girl appear ? what ' s with her eyesight ? etcetera , etcetera . < br / > < br / > visually it ' s ok , more or less , if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads . 
NEG the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster . you end up disliking most of the characters and you don ' t particularly like any of them . < br / > < br / > even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don ' t care one bit about them . the movie has no plot , no direction and no purpose . the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that ' s hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste . 
NEG the decoy is one of those independent productions , made by obvious newcomers , but it doesn ' t have all the usual flaws that sink most such films . it has a definite story , it has adequate acting , the photography is very good , the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men , and the background music isn ' t overdone . this is a dvd new release , so people will be looking here to see if it ' s worthwhile . i don ' t know where all the 10 ' s come from , as there ' s no way this film is that good - - - even if you ' re the filmmaker ' s mother . < br / > < br / > the last film we saw at a theater was warner ' s trashing of j k rawlings much - loved and excellent book , order of the phoenix . in comparing the decoy with phoenix , consider that phoenix ( as made by warners ) had no story , certainly no acting was allowed by the director , the photography was dreadful , and the wall - of - sound overbearing musical score was just a mess . i rated phoenix a " 1 " because the scale doesn ' t go any lower . the decoy is 4 times better - - in all regards . < br / > < br / > if you have the opportunity , give the decoy a chance . remember , this isn ' t " decoy 3 - - the shootout " or any such nonsense . it ' s original . if your expectations aren ' t overblown by the foolish " 10 " scores here , you might just enjoy the film on its own terms . 
NEG this was an awful movie ! not for the subject matter , but for the delivery . i went with my girlfriend at the time ( when the movie came out ) , expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression . what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression , with no uplift at the end . the previews and ads made no mention of this ! plus , for all that they played up whoopi goldberg , my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes ! again , the previews say nothing about this ! ( not that you would expect that , but it ' s just more of the problem ) . if i had known how depressing this movie would be , i would ' ve never have seen it . or at least , i would ' ve been prepared for it . this was a bait and switch ad campaign , and i will never see this movie again ! 
NEG i was expecting a b - movie french musical . after all , dhéry , blanche , defunès were superstars of low budget french films of that time . and it is in color ! but i have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity . musical numbers are awful , and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid . and the songs ? what songs ? this is just a succession of bad numbers , one after another . the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women . it was not familiar at that time . in fact , some numbers are just there to show us topless women . it adds to the mediocrity ! and try to find young michel serrault , the future great actor of french cinema , in a bit part as a musician , in his very first movie . good luck ! 
NEG this is definitely one of the weirder 70 ' s movies out there , and it ' s most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot hysteria . it is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie , especially when the dark , moody first half is replaced by a musical interlude of all things ( as another user pointed out , one of the songs is dedicated to a character , travis crabtree , who paddles around in a canoe for a while , then . . . leaves , never to be seen again ) . although it ' s painfully dated now , i ' s still a fun scary movie to show to kids , and anyone who enjoys either bigfoot lore or 70 ' s hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this . my favorite part : a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door ( ! ? ) and the narrator explains he went unconscious from " shock . " uh , i ' d say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious , but whatever . < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 stars , or 7 / 10 if you like bad americana . 
NEG this movie is simply far too long , far too repetitive , with the male nudity and sexuality being ( as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles ) far too gratuitous and unnecessary . much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience ( and stamina ) of an audience . < br / > < br / > i saw this movie on an early saturday afternoon , with a film festival audience ; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome , interested in more experimental or atypical films , such as one without much dialog , shorts , foreign films . the near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the " pay off " ( which never actually arrived ) , i have never , in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals , experimental , gay and otherwise , seen such a large number of people walk away from a film . < br / > < br / > this movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was . it also could have gone in different directions , still with a shorter running time , and been far more effective . < br / > < br / > as it currently exists , this is not something that one can readily recommend or one i would have any desire to watch again . 
NEG wow . i read about this movie and it sounded so awful that i had to see it , and my gosh , i can smell it in st louis . where do i start ? national lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of animal house , but they completely missed the mark . i ' ll go chronologically with these short flicks . < br / > < br / > short film # 1 < br / > < br / > poor peter riegert ( boon from animal house ) . apparently , he wasn ' t working back then , so the boys at national lampoons probably called and said " hey , we ' re making a c * * ppy movie , wanna be in it ? " peter was like " well , i ' m not doing much these days , why not ? " he was a great side character in animal house , but he couldn ' t carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes . < br / > < br / > possible spoiler the premise is funny enough , with jason cooper ( riegert ) telling his wife to leave him , she needs to find herself . it ' s too weird that they ' re actually in a happy marriage . so he chases her off , there she goes , and cooper is in charge of the kids . this , off course , leads to him burning the house down , losing several of the kids , and sleeping with an assortment of new york bimbos ( including an ever so young diane lane ) . then the wife comes back , wants the kids , and the film ends with a coin flip that ' ll decide the fate of the children . the idea was actually somewhat clever , but the director stunk . the characters all seem like they ' re falling asleep , they had to be doped up . sorry boon , your legacy was tarnished with this flop . < br / > < br / > short film # 2 < br / > < br / > more spoilers < br / > < br / > enter dominique corsaire . pretty girl , recently finished college , not sure what to do with her life . so she becomes a slut , starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys , takes their money when they die , and she doesn ' t stop until she beds the most powerful man in the world , fred willard ( ooops , i mean the president of the united states ) . once again , it could have been funny , and though i was happy that corsaire ( ann dusenberry in real life ) wasn ' t afraid to bare all , her acting was horrible . what a waste of time . < br / > < br / > short film # 3 < br / > < br / > i can ' t believe i made it this far . here ' s the rookie cop brent falcone ( robby benson ) with veteran stan nagurski ( richard widmark ) . falcone is young , naive , thinks he can really help people , though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times . nagurski , really , has just given up caring . he watches muggings , assaults , you name it , and never intervenes . he figures the world is lawless and he ' ll probably get sued if he does anything . even christopher lloyd ( at the end of taxi ' s run ) gets in on the action , getting the police called on him , committing a crime , but having his lawyer there to protect him . god bless america ! ! < br / > < br / > once again , could have been funny , the performances were intentionally campy , but goodness , no energy whatsoever . henry jaglom and bob giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock . i think the writing wasn ' t bad , the ideas were there , but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the iranian hostage crisis . if i had been a part of this film , i would want my name removed , it ' s horrible . then again , that ' s why i watched it . < br / > < br / > the only good thing about this garbage is that dr john did the film score ( repeating " going to the movies " over and over again ) and the film isn ' t much longer than an hour and a half . show this one in film classes with the heading " what you should never do in film - making . " this script should have been left on the shelf because yep , it ' s that bad . 
NEG no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed . i wish i could get my time back . nice skull face broad really smiles , bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script . i was ( ( spoiler ) ) happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end , especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset . eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten , putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption . overall , i found most of it pointless , though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity , happy to witness the demise of cast , in a way though , wishing that journey never happened ( probably should ' ve been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night , ugh ) . 
NEG a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself . 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won ' t turn out like his father . all the stock characters are in place : the nice couple ; the " funny " guy ; the tough ( but sensitive ) hood ; the smart girl ( she wears glasses - - that ' s how we know ) ; the nerd and two no - personality blondes . it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life ( don ' t ask ) and kills people . i knew i was in trouble when , after a great opening scene , we jump to 20 years later - - all bad horror movies do that ! < br / > < br / > the dialogue is atrocious , the acting is bad ( except for betsy palmer - - why betsy ? ) and the killings are stupid and / or unimaginative . my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he ' s fully dressed ! a real bad , stupid incoherent horror film . avoid at all costs . 
NEG this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush . i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by . however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding , this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing . the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add , many times before . there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others . i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space . in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film . what i ' ve said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review , than for god ' s sake don ' t waste more time watching this movie . the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at 2 : 00 a . m . in that case go ahead see what i care . 
NEG despite pretty bad reviews , i just had to give this film a go  it does , after all , star hk super - babe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all - action cat - burglars . surely that ' s worth checking out ? well , as babe - fests go , martial angels is hard to beat . the eye candy is top quality . shu qi looks as fantastic as always , and of the rest of the girls , rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particular . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits , it is an absolute stinker ! the story is weak , the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic . director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else . < br / > < br / > if shu qi is the only reason you ' re contemplating seeing this one , you would be better off watching sex and zen 2 again ! 
NEG there was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film ( zoe mclellan ) but even her looks couldn ' t stop me from voting it the lowest possible - one . < br / > < br / > the plot is bad and irrational . < br / > < br / > what more can i say . the movie sucks . 
NEG what the f * @ # was this i just watched ? steven stop ! ! please ! this movie is insatiably bad and silly . in a bizarre departure from action and adventure , mr . seagal is now fighting ( obviously ) wish - they - were - vampire ' like ' creatures with super human strength . ? ok ? oh , and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way ? wow ! even still in this movie however , to quell seagals have - to - have - the - last - punch - and - no - one - can - kick - my - a $ $ ego , he is somehow stronger than they are . however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him . come on , i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer , but these are super human strength people . oh and get this , seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues , because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is wolverine ! oh my go . . . and worst than all of that ! yes , there is a worse than that . he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face . they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film . it was pure madness . although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end . this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven . awful ! awful ! awful ! two thumbs down ! redemeption qualities ? well i guess so , i will be fair in that aspect . at least some of the special effects were ok , and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses . the women all were quite attractive imo . still , and i said still , it does not make up for the blatant x - men , underworld , ( insert your favorite zombie , vampire movie here ) rip off ! the director , writer , producer , all should be bansihed & exile from the movie business . i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood rayne ( and just about all other uwe boll pictures ) about this film . that ' s my whole $ 1 . 00 on this film . view if you dare . 
NEG i think its time for seagal to go quietly into the night . what i have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90 ' s smash hits in comparison . < br / > < br / > a secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human ' s adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something . somehow seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world . . . or something . seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans , every time i look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well i know steven ' s athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him ? usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close . like i said , it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting . the problem was it wasn ' t really scary and seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb seagal killed them all singlehandedly ? i guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask seagal to come to the strip club with them . < br / > < br / > 2 out of 10 
NEG okay , first off , seagal ' s voice is dubbed over for like 50 % of the film . . . why ? because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions . from the very beginning , you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting , but they make no sense . < br / > < br / > that said , the story still sucked and doesn ' t make any sense at all . when i got the the end , i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn ' t even make sense . < br / > < br / > avoid like the plague . this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse . 
NEG okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying / renting . the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci - fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing . 
NEG please save your money and go see something else . this movie was such piece of crap . i didnt want to go , but i had to so i thought i ' d laugh at least once , nope . not a single laugh , it was that horrible ! chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and " a night at the roxbury . " this movie is completely obvious , has no smart humor at all , and just repeats itself over and over again . listen to me , and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can ! 
NEG i could only get through about 25 mins of it . not one laugh in the 25 minutes i gave it , one of the most painful films i ' ve ever had to endure . chris kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him . just a horrible movie . 
NEG nu image , ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly $ 2 million . some feature extensive effects work , others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both - - for $ 2 million . < br / > < br / > mr . hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million dollars but it ' s painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $ 750 , 000 if not considerably less than that . few sets are utilized , a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish . < br / > < br / > it ' s painful to watch . not so much because it is poorly directed , poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget . < br / > < br / > those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by p . t . barnum . 
NEG it ' s difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred i have of this film . but i ' ll try : < br / > < br / > every other word was an expletive , the sex scenes were uncomfortable , drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm , if not offensive to italian - americans . < br / > < br / > i ' m not saying the acting was terrible , because leguizamo , sorvino , brody , espisito et . al , performed well . but . . . almost every character in the film i despised . not since the bonfire of the vanities have i disliked every character on screen . 
NEG this long winded film turns out to be less about berkowitz and his effect on nyc , but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italian - americans , known locally as " guidos . " the problem is that " guidos " are uninteresting , no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in . they are already living caricatures , so lee only amplifies them , rather than simply portraying them . < br / > < br / > when someone has a caricature done of themselves , they don ' t go home and say , " hey , let ' s make the ears and nose even bigger ! " that ' s what lee has done in this film . the most interesting characters in the film are the two ( adrian brody and jennifer esposito ) who wish to escape the " guido " lifestyle . top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters , particularly john leguizamo ' s , and you get a nice film to fall asleep by . especially considering it ' s lengthy run time . < br / > < br / > one more strike against it : for someone proclaiming to be a yankees fan , and has grown up in new york , spike lee should know how to spell phil rizzuto , which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits . 
NEG this movie is bad news and i ' m really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this . i imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across hollywood blvd . as a result of this fiasco . what really gets you is that it could have been good . the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales , but this is a flop . the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end , and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten . what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him , as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes . as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork . he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes . but the question remains . . . can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere . 
NEG once again i took a chance and rented this bag of crap . billed as a horror flick , there wasn ' t one scene , not one , that was even remotely scarey . not one ! ! sure there was some nudity , but all the lesbian action got a little old . i guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie ' s saving grace ? and dan , what an annoying ass bag ! ! right from the beginning i knew i was in for it when good ol ' dan first spoke . and he was suppose to be intimidating ? what a laugh ! ! all in all , this movie is dreadfully awful ! how in the hell do movies like this get made ? if you want a movie with a few thrills in it , don ' t rent this one . this movie is about as thrilling as the teletubbies . 
NEG i ' d like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan ( with a few notable exceptions ) , and i generally have a low opinion of so - called otakus , as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky - haired , big - eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors , such as the plot . and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash , fatal fury : the motion picture . < br / > < br / > as seen through the glassy , witless eyes of an otaku , there ' s little to find fault with in fatal fury - - there ' s plenty of quirky japanese - y humor , one - on - one duels , some " dramatic " moments , and everything is beautifully drawn . but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched , predictable plot with cliched , predictable characters , culminating in a cliched , predictable ending . the love scenes are hilariously overblown - - the scene in which sulia " heals " terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment , but it ' s virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it . and of course , fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon t & a - - this is supplied gratuitously by the huge - breasted mai shiranui . and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name ( oh boy ) , we ' re treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever ( they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on , only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point ) . this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle , in which all the main characters engage the all - powerful main villain in one - on - one combat in turn . that ' s some thing that ' s always amused me . . . even when battles in animes aren ' t taking place in a tournament , they always happen as if they were , regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever ! < br / > < br / > otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons , and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury . so would fatal fury have been good if it wasn ' t an anime ? the answer is an emphatic " no " - - all of this movie ' s charm , what little of it there is , resides in the actual drawings . had fatal fury not been an anime , it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000 , if the show was still on the air . that ' s the key - - this is nothing more than a laughably bad b - movie in the guise of an anime epic . if you ' re a fan of movies so bad that they ' re actually entertaining , consider renting fatal fury ( or catch it on the sci - fi channel ) , as it is definitely one of those . if you ' re an otaku , please wake up and realize that a good 90 % of the stuff you ' re watching is garbage . as for everyone else , buy a dreamcast and fatal fury : mark of the wolves , but don ' t even consider seeing this movie . 
NEG and i thought the beach was bad , with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time , nicolas cage . don ' t blame him for the awful script , if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie , give your self a pat on the back . its a cross between the village and a crappier script . its starts off kinda catching your eye , and then as it goes further into the plot , it just makes no sense , and don ' t get me started about the ending ! ! ! ! what was that ? the only thing that makes this movie exist is nicolas cage usual great humor , and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations . if you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch , save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why , just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind , and there you go ! 
NEG waitress : honey , here ' s them eggs you ordered . honey , like bee , get it ? that ' s called pointless foreshadowing . < br / > < br / > edward basket : huh ? ( on the road ) basket : here ' s your doll back , little girl . you really shouldn ' t be so careless with your belongings . < br / > < br / > little girl : yeah , whatever . < br / > < br / > crash ! boom ! whoosh ! crackle basket : i think that something bad is about to happen . < br / > < br / > ( later ) basket : mmmm . vicodin ! what the ?

NEG a phenomenal achievement in awfulness . it ' s actually hilariously awful . < br / > < br / > first off . . . nicholas cage must now have made it to the finals in the over - emoting category in his acting class . wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a " hero " character that you have no vested interest in . < br / > < br / > i don ' t know what it is with neil labute and female characters . he makes females out to be totally deviant and evil . . . and pays them back by having cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all " b * * * * es " a few times too . i ' ve enjoyed labute ' s early films and a few of his plays . . . but it ' s a strange fascination he has . < br / > < br / > i ' d give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on ellen burstyn ' s performance . by the time she finally makes her appearance ( bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead ) it seems like all hope may be lost . she deserves an oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue , white , and gold face paint booming about the wicker man you know that working with scorcese and friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well . < br / > < br / > this movie is so wrong - headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed . < br / > < br / > highlights include : nicholas cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill . < br / > < br / > nicholas cage stealing a bicycle and looking like ms . gulch from the wizard of oz riding around on it . < br / > < br / > nicholas cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl . < br / > < br / > leelee sobieski plummeting from a once - promising acting career in a " brawl " with cage . < br / > < br / > ellen burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu . < br / > < br / > nicholas cage screaming " who burned it ? who burned it ? who burned it ? who burned it ? who burned it ? who burned it ? " for no reason . < br / > < br / > nicholas cage in a bear costume ( i ' m not kidding ) running through the woods , taking off the costume ( but leaving the bear feet on ) and then doing some karate moves to some villains . < br / > < br / > and you haven ' t lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin ' s basement . < br / > < br / > needless to say , if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal . there was actually a point in the movie where i stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn ' t an elaborate send - up of " hysteria " films . . . only to be reminded when cage would scream / shout / whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously . < br / > < br / > i think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again . . . just because it ' s so dreadful . 
NEG normally when i write a review for a movie online , it is for one of three reasons . either , i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent , i feel that the public ' s perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons , or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers . while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative , i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as , " this is one of the best films of all time ! " , does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides , nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good , which should be the point of the review in the first place . with that being said , war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried , incompetent attempt at a money grab ; piggy - backing its loathsome carcass on the multi - million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg . many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject . this movie is not even " so bad " that it becomes funny or endearing , rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger . now with most of the insults out of the way , allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i . < br / > < br / > judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film ( i found it as sam ' s club for 8 bucks ) , i assumed that the cast would be no - names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular . check . this is not a big deal for me , as i find a large budget and an over - reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie . i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score . check again . what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien / battle scenes . < br / > < br / > now , as per imdb ' s policy any spoilers must be announced in advance , no matter how small , so here is fair warning . the movie opens with a lot of inane small - talk , followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot . seriously , it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube . it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth , but by the end of the first ten minutes , the combination of shaky camera - work , spliced scenes , and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer . however , the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going . the next 30 minutes basically go as follows : one of the main characters walks to one of the pods , he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot . they both walk back to town . these walks aren ' t two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged . they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie . in a particularly grueling scene , the main character is shown looking at a pod , then he is shown pacing and panting , then he looks at the pod , then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town , then comes in to town and walks into a building , then he has a cup of coffee and says " thank you mary " to a random maid that serves him coffee , then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building , then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod . i apologize for the extreme run - on sentence , but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film . characters speak way too long about mundane things , they walk a lot , they send other people to walk , the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed , but for no dramatic effect , simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere . the editing is mind - bogglingly bad . people actions make little sense . for instance , when the professor goes to a farmer ' s house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town , the farmer stutters and paces around . when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside , the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later . nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene , as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk . the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film , but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion . i have seen better high school video productions . finally , the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story . i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage . however , it is so awful in technical aspects , and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad . avoid this film at all costs . 
NEG the wicker man . i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this movie . < br / > < br / > the plot was ridiculous , thinly tied together , and altogether - just lame . nicolas cage . . . shame on you ! i assumed that since you were in it , that it would be at least decent . it was not . < br / > < br / > i felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor , and even if it ' s complete - the movie was just outlandish and silly . < br / > < br / > at the end you ' re left mouth agape , mind befuddled and good taste offended . i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred . people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall , four floors down from the theater near the entrance . it ' s that bad . < br / > < br / > i heard it compared to : glitter , american werewolf in paris and gigli . my boyfriend was so mad he wouldn ' t even talk about it . < br / > < br / > grrrr ! 
NEG beverly garland was born in the wrong time . she was an actress ahead of her time , bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the corman films she starred in . in gunslinger , she ' s the town sheriff ' s wife . he gets offed , so she takes over his job to pursue his killers . she ' s better than the material she ' s working with , by far . the movie is gray , stilted , and mostly boring . there ' s some ( unintentional ) humor with the tire tracks everywhere , people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another ( i ' ve heard of false fronts , but this is ridiculous ! ) , and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her . even if she hadn ' t loved her husband , it had only been something like a week or two since he ' d died ! and she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end , anyway . no luck with men , this one . < br / > < br / > the villain of the piece is another woman , the saloon owner . she ' s scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich . her plan of action if it doesn ' t is pretty lame - she ' ll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle . hell , it ' s just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town . are you telling me these people aren ' t armed ? look what happened in real towns of the old west when bank robbers came in to rob the bank , then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk . < br / > < br / > there ' a a lot of pointless talking and riding around , interspersed with a few lame shoot outs . the ending is as grim as usual in a corman flick , although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in it conquered the world . the sheriff turns over her badge to sam bass and rides off into the sunset , although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun . 
NEG 1st watched 2 / 28 / 2006 - 4 out of 10 ( dir - sydney pollack ) : - dvd version i watched titled " 3 days of the condor " - so so cia drama full of laid - back performances making for a very laid - back movie . the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford ' s character , codename = condor , being the one that was left . who killed them and why ? that ' s what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time . along the way , he gets faye dunaway ' s character involved involved , originally because he needs a place to hide , and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey - dovey time . this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn ' t have a lot of suspense . the flat performances don ' t help and the finish doesn ' t seal the deal for the audience enough either . despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers , the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be . 
NEG the good news is a movie was made , drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec - american ( is such a word exists ) cast . the bad news is , it was dead at birth . < br / > < br / > if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic ' night of the living dead , ' this is what we might have come up with . ' the legend of diablo ' is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of ' mystery science theatre 3000 ! ' < br / > < br / > i don ' t think one can even call this a ' b ' movie . the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8 - mm film shot by a group of school kids . < br / > < br / > some spoilers < br / > < br / > the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it . a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community . his daughters , one hot and one homely , team with a gringo fbi man and a priest , to try to re - cage the demon . < br / > < br / > meanwhile , every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re - enacted - poorly . these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead ! the supposed infrared scenes from the demon ' s viewpoint are nothing special and he / she / it sure seems to back up a lot ( as opposed to turning around the moving forward ) . and the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fast - motion is ludicrous ! it really , really appears to be done for comic effect - although i know it wasn ' t ! i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing & for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach ! < br / > < br / > of course the darth vader / field of dreams voice , calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical . then again , so was most of this cheese ball ! robert napton , director and writer of the screenplay , should win something for this effort ! ( how about a lifetime blackballing , like the ' hollywood 10 ? ' ) this one , i now see , is rated 1 . 5 on a 10 - scale . i fear this might be a tad generous ! < br / > < br / > is there anything good about this movie ? well , lindsey lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff . this is probably why her homely older sister ( calvi pabon ) really ran away from home ! fred estrado is reasonably decent as the fbi agent . i wonder if mario soto , who played father rodriguez , is the same mario soto who pitched for the cincinnati reds ? if so , he should have stuck to baseball . in fact , they couldn ' t have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it ' demons in the outfield ! ' < br / > < br / > if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class , i will issue apologies . it might be good enough for a b or even b + as long as the gang got the college ' s camcorder back to campus in one piece ! ' the blair witch project ' proved that a cool , campy movie could be made on a shoestring . ' the legend of diablo , ' though , didn ' t appear to have a shoestring or shoes to work from ! it was low - budget , low - talent , low - everything . the very final scene - and i mean about the final 10 seconds of the film - is the only mildly creative or interesting moment . < br / > < br / > i paid $ 3 . 45 to rent this . i could have better spent it on a hamburger ! 
NEG florence chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer , of course . she swam the english channel both directions . she swam from catalina island to the california coast . marilyn bell ' s is a sweet story , but the usual glorification of us canadians in the face of a superior world . another sample of our inferiority complex . our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies . that ' s pretty good . better than lebanon . what should we do about hockey though . . . ? and curling . the notion of calling this a sport , of its inclusion in the olympics . . . ! ah , but we digress . . . 
NEG the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 ' s soap opera . deeply character - driven films are great , but only if the characters are compelling . and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel . the villain ' s dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist . the great lt . columbo himself is no where near his famous , lovable , self - effacing , crumpled self ; and the bride / kidnap victim is a whimpering , one - dimensional damsel - in - distress ( she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on ! ! ! i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you - know - what in 2 seconds ) . in any sense of reality , this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little . and speaking of reality . . . . the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police . the police ? ? give me a break . everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case . this was no columbo , just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt . columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours . 
NEG spoilers ahead , but does it really matter ? have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions ? could this be it ? why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world ? why is this question never answered ? why was the opening text crawl incoherent ? why would a nun ( she sure seemed nice ! ) hand over 20 orphans to a madman ? has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver ? why does one of the gold mine ' s shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage ? why does tara reid ' s character suddenly show up at christian slater ' s apartment for sex ? ( or did i just answer my own question ? ) why would even a non - archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer ? why would modern computers still display green pre - tron - era grid outlines of objects , complete with little " bleeps " ? and must all movie explosive timers have digital displays ? why doesn ' t anything in this movie make any sense ? 
NEG snow white , which just came out in locarno , where i had the chance to see it , of course refers to the world famous fairy tale . and it also refers to coke . in the end , real snow of the swiss alps plays its part as well . < br / > < br / > thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film . there is a lot of dope on scene , and there is also a pale , dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue . < br / > < br / > but : it ' s not a fairy tale . it ' s supposed to be a realistic drama located in zurich , switzerland ( according to the tagline ) . < br / > < br / > technically the movie is close to perfect . unfortunately a weak plot , foreseeable dialogs , a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don ' t add up to create authenticity . thus as a spectator i remained untouched . < br / > < br / > and then there were the clichés , which drove me crazy one by one : snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them , because they were so busy all the time . her best girlfriend , on the other hand , has loving and caring parents . they ( a steelworker and a housewife ) live in a tiny flat , poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in . the good guy ( = prince ) is a musician ( ! ) from the french speaking part of switzerland ( which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country ) . he has problems with his parents . they are migrants from spain , who don ' t seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed . < br / > < br / > and so it goes on : naturally , the drug dealer is brutal , the bankers are heartless , the club owner is a playboy and the photographer , although a woman ( ! ) , has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a show . < br / > < br / > this review doesn ' t need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot . as i like other films by samir , e . g . " forget baghdad " , i was quite disappointed . let ' s hope for the next one . 
NEG i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format . columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods . this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past . and that is the disturbing point , because columbo is no ordinary detective . < br / > < br / > there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing . first , i can ' t figure out the title of this movie . it is misleading . maybe a better title would ' ve been " the vanishing bride " or something similar . second , columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason ( to the viewers at least ) why he does it . < br / > < br / > i don ' t feel betrayed , just disappointed . i ' m glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo . < br / > < br / > 
NEG anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation . this movie is a painful suckfest . the acting is stiff , the stock generic soundtrack is laughable , the direction is bland and strangest of all , the teacher really isn ' t all that attractive ( making the student ' s blatant advances all the more awkward ) . the creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude . i ' m certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money squandered on this project . hell , the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack - addict ; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it . for the sole reason that it didn ' t give me a terminal illness , i ' ll give this film a two . 
NEG yeah , stupidity ! i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth . too much colors , too much unnecessary " addons " to a story , too much stupid characters ( i presume they wanted to achieve comic relief , but i only wanted to cry ) . . . too much of everything . shame to spoil one of divine stories from " arabian nights " like this . childish , naive ( both on a bad way ) and with lot of magic - breaking mistakes , i don ' t think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes . princess is lovely , but should be tongueless , cause actress don ' t know how to carry a role . rest of the cast is even worse . . . our " bad guy " is really bad . shame that the " good guy " is not better . only light in this dark is , of course , david carradine , who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this , but at least keep his actor / " fighter " skills at top . i ' m still sorry to see him in a thing like this , but glad that i had something to watch in whole charade , so thank you david . only , only , for him , i give this 2 stars to this fiasco . . . i would give more for him , but that would rise final score to entire movie . the rest is so bad , that i would , maybe , like to grade it , but there is no grade lover then 1 here , and i think that would be too much . 
NEG i saw the movie last night here at home , but i thought it was too long first of all . second , the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before . the things isn ' t funny in the movie : fiancé hitting his girlfriend , beatings . the movie was way too long - - talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing ! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture - - like the lady singing - - i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here ! come on perry , you can do better then this ! 
NEG the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man - eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume : " can somebody please pass the ketchup ? " i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative ; it works better than an overdose of demarol . 
NEG no , not the administration of gwb , the decider / strutter / smirker - - but the mini - series " monarch cove . " lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time , most of them broadcast between 11 p . m . friday nights and 1 a . m . saturday mornings . as to why i watched the whole thing , i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism . < br / > < br / > most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown . the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward , who turn in the only decent performances ( jones doesn ' t make it through the entire series - - lucky woman ) . ward , by the way , is aging quite well since her " thorn birds " days . < br / > < br / > the one main thread to the plot - - who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dad ' s murder but is freed after six years in the slammer - - is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won ' t especially care who dun it . there is a great deal of " steamy " sex , several murders , and all sorts of rude behavior - - virtually none of which is either interesting or credible . most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented . the writing and direction is on a par with the cast . < br / > < br / > if you stick around to the end , the post card is a ( very minor ) hoot . < br / > < br / > consider yourself warned ! 
NEG the film starts with a manager ( nicholas bell ) giving welcome investors ( robert carradine ) to primal park . a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna , like ¨ jurassik park ¨ , and some scientists resurrect one of nature ' s most fearsome predators , the sabretooth tiger or smilodon . scientific ambition turns deadly , however , and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific . meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre - historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . in addition , a security agent ( stacy haiduk ) and her mate ( brian wimmer ) fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons . the sabretooths , themselves , of course , are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing . the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature ' s most fearsome predators . furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims . < br / > < br / > the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair - raising chills , full of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects . the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring . the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy . middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food . actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . no for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following : ¨ sabretooth ( 2002 ) ¨ by james r hickox with vanessa angel , david keith and john rhys davies and the much better ¨ 10 . 000 bc ( 2006 ) ¨ by roland emmerich with with steven strait , cliff curtis and camilla belle . this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . miller is an australian director usually working for television ( tidal wave , journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( the man from snowy river , zeus and roxanne , robinson crusoe ) . rating : below average , bottom of barrel . 
NEG to anyone not familiar with c . s . forrester ' s book this film should be interesting . it is colorful , well acted and depicts high adventure , but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling . i could hardly sit through it . < br / > < br / > for some reason screen - writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on . of course , the spoken word is different from the written word , and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film . but , why do the screen - writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it ? in this case the writers out - did themselves . < br / > < br / > just a few examples : there was no mutiny on the renown . the officers did take over the ship after the half - insane captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway - for reasons implied but never given . there was no court martial . the court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere . captain pellew does not appear appear in this part of the hornblower saga , nor does col . ortega ' s wife . hornblower , himself , was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore . there are plenty of such manipulations of forrester ' s story . < br / > < br / > on a purely technical basis , i think the film ' s repeated use of the flash - back device hurts the continuity of the story . < br / > < br / > why , oh why did screen - writers have to mess up a good story ? 
NEG a real head scratcher of a film by bill rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties . three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $ 1 million provided he or she makes it that far . a series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar . most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of american bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers . if there was any hesitation that white people can ' t dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin . pay close attention for the nipple slip . this continues on for about forty - five minutes until bill rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess . it ' s a game until it ' s not a game . the three old coots are in complete control until they ' re not . the hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props . they ' re dead until they ' re not . even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn ' t know what the hell happened . i defy anyone to reason where rebane was going on this one . the acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner . most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local stuckey ' s . i give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself . let ' s see gone with the wind do that ! this chilling classics collection is really becoming the bane of me . bane , get it ! like rebane ! i hate myself . 
NEG this could be a cute movie for kids my grandson watched it once . he was watching it a second time i was watching some of it with him . < br / > < br / > when the little bear gets lost on the ice burg and he is in the water he is trying to get to a piece of ice it says " come back stupid ass fool " . < br / > < br / > i don ' t want my 3 year old grandson watching movies with words like this in it . < br / > < br / > that is why its rated for children . should be child friendly . that is what i would expect . put out by warner brothers and g rated i would expect this to not have cuss words in it . the words don ' t even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later . and the movie drags out in many parts . 
NEG monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american concrete factory ( are there any else in hollywood ? ) polluting the waters of the small colombian town of chimayo somehow creating a catfish - like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women . james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to chimayo by his foul - mouthed boss barnes who himself can ' t keep his hands off of his secretary ' s rear to get to the bottom ( pun intended ) of the story . while in chimayo bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america . i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns . there is also a radical named sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which , by the way , also supplies the town with jobs for the locals , but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy - feely enviro - marxism . pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex - girlfriend on the beach , tells her that he is seeing the mayor ' s daughter juanita and it ' s over between them , then she is promptly eaten that night . a little side action without the evidence . my hat is off to you sir . john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to punish sinners . you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face . might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check didn ' t bounce . < br / > < br / > supposedly based on a true story , so much so they say it twice in the opening credits , this film is awful on all fronts . filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth hartford put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters , even putting his daughter , andrea in top billing with mitchum and carradine . the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming . this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night . the monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending . james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed . utterly unwatchable dreck . shame on you john carradine . 
NEG this is one of the worst movies i ' ve ever encountered , but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted . . < br / > < br / > as far as pure film - making technique goes , this director is competent . he ' s held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera , but the actual editing , camera angles , camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional . i ' ve seen many movies where the " directing " was much worse . at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there . also , the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere . there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera , and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go . as far as artistic merit , there is none . the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film . this is pure trash . . . total garbage . < br / > < br / > the gore is decent for a film in this budget range . , it ' s obviously fake but there ' s lot ' s of it , and it ' s very outlandish . . < br / > < br / > i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing . this was a good idea ( and it ' s the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film ) . . . unfortunately , it ' s overdone , especially towards the end . < br / > < br / > it ' s really a terrible film , but i have to recommend it for it ' s camp value . it ' s really hard to find a movie that ' s worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category . 
NEG this review is based on the dubbed shock - o - rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002 . how bad is it ? it ' s awful , which is what a ' 1 ' represents on the imdb scale - - but it ' s much worse than that . it ' s nice to imagine that an original german - language print might improve matters - - the comedic english - language dubbing isn ' t funny at all - - but truthfully , this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you ' re likely to see . the zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever , and they don ' t seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal . however , they ' re also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation . george romero ' s land of the dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence ; here , zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director andreas schnaas . utterly without redeeming social value , and even worse , entirely lacking as entertainment , zombie ' 90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it . 
NEG or : it ' s a bird ? it ' s a plane ? no , look . . . it ' s a disaster ! or : no need to look up in the sky . < br / > < br / > or : ( . . . ok , that ' s enough . ) if singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record , he failed . the sr structure can ' t do this , the dark and restricted color scheme ( i would call it " wishi - washi " ) , the boring usual dialogs , the clown with advanced alien technology , the missing fun and magic , etc . makes the movie completely disappointing . < br / > < br / > it simply doesn ' t work . < br / > < br / > the main thing at a character like superman is , that he is a superhero . that ' s the core , the most important thing . < br / > < br / > love trouble and a sadly lost depressive supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a 2 : 40 long superman movie , not the whole time . < br / > < br / > because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore . it ' s like a ( and in this case a very bad and boring ) social study , where every 30 minutes a person flies around . < br / > < br / > that ' s a big difference . < br / > < br / > this movie is a joke . holy skywalker , this is superman , so give us supervillains , superaction and the most important thing , superfun . < br / > < br / > we want entertainment ! singer , if you want to make a 2 : 40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people ? then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake . < br / > < br / > they say : superman returns . and then , supersadlysoftie stands in the door . < br / > < br / > maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite , but one bad movie can ' t do this . don ' t give up , they plan a sequel . . . < br / > < br / > next time singer ( and warner brothers ) , make a superhero movie , not a depressive superlame soap , or let it be . a superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic . < br / > < br / > this movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover . yes , technically there are all sorts in , yes , there is a lot of small talks , there are a few jokes , a view action scenes , etc , but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality . < br / > < br / > it ' s not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my live . < br / > < br / > the ridiculous cast strategy ( cast them young as possible , so we can make sequels in the next 25 years ) gives the rest . kate bosworth plays a 22 year old star reporter , she ' s looking like 19 . superman was full five years away , so he slept with her 6 years ago , so she was 16 , ( looking like 13 ) and a daily planet reporter , wroting " i spend a night with superman " . warner brothers , that ' s too much . < br / > < br / > routh is not so bad , he is playing a little bit wooden , but the whole movie is wooden , so . . . ? ! temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey . the rest , forget it . even spacey , this is not his terrain . < br / > < br / > reeve / hackman / kidder were acting so easy , with fun . what a difference . < br / > < br / > the jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too . what the hell should that be ? the problem here is , they mean this serious , not as a joke . next time spiderman or batman or ironman falls and rises like jesus or angels ? or they speak with god directly . why not ? they are superheroes , saving human lives every day . so at least one talk with god every week should be possible . . . oh my god . < br / > < br / > maybe this was not the real announced movie , instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe . < br / > < br / > for the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history . not only because of the money . < br / > < br / > i understand how difficult it ( maybe ) was to create and transport some messages or feelings , but showing lone , lost and sadly people isn ' t new and thousands of movies or tv - shows did it better , in very old or new ones like magnolia . and the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman , sorry , superman of course . < br / > < br / > singer and wb , that ' s simply nothing . in fact it ' s even more than nothing , it ' s like a black hole that destroys the passion for ( comic / superhero ) movies and steals us three hours of our life . < br / > < br / > mrs . smilla ' s little brother . ( very angry and green like the hulk . ) 
NEG this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological . i stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater , their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes - - eyes wandering at their neighbor , wondering if it was just them . i mean , how could the movie really be bad . nobody ' ll admit it , it ' s a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes . " who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner ? " but the fact remains , every member of the audience is thinking what i ' m writing right now . i actually plagiarized their faces . < br / > < br / > obviously lois is only aroused by power , she won ' t even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesn ' t stop jet liners . it can ' t be the look in " his " eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that . in the old supermans , she had some level of connection with him , he wasn ' t priority number 1 , obviously , but it strengthened her character that she was " torn " . i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kent . < br / > < br / > and now it ' s official , kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg . person . < br / > < br / > superman " one " he loses his earth dad , then finds his real super dad , the story is captivating every step of the way . he ' s human , he relates to people and he feels love for people , he relates to highschool students , he relates to people who feel different . he relates . the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems he ' s just " doing a job " when he ' s saving people . < br / > < br / > there ' s something about clark that lois likes , she ' s really internally in love with him but can ' t admit it , and when he comes into the picture as superman , it throws a kink in the on - the - rocks love . without superman , she would ' ve fallen in love with clark ( at least that ' s what the movie points to , whether it was the intention or not ) . superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman , clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois . literally . < br / > < br / > superman two i just watched it again . as a kid , i " thought " i enjoyed the action , but now i know it was the story that held me then too , watching it over and over again . if i saw superman returns as a child , i would ' ve hated it then too , i think . < br / > < br / > there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie , it ' s sick . superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile , meanwhile , lex luther ' s got something fantastic up his sleeve . < br / > < br / > superman three now there ' s a three - way love story between superman and lana and clark , only humanity wins and clark ' s inner nature beats superman ' s power , because when his supermoral nature is gone and he ' s superhuman ( who does human things with his superpowers ) , she sees it ' s not the power of superman that she ' s in love with , it ' s not superpowerman , but supermortalman that she loves - - and who ' s really super . and when she tells clark she " prefers " him to superman , he is elated , he has made a human connection again . he wants to be accepted for who he is , not just for his ability to bend steel . this is the kind of stuff that ' s missing from superman returns . < br / > < br / > clark super - sneezes to help the kid get a strike - humanity again . plus , it ' s an ineresting use of superpowers . he ' s not just using straight brute strength . < br / > < br / > he crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers , love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving . < br / > < br / > it seems there ' s nothing at stake in superman returns . even in superman three , we see the damages caused by the nemesis ' world domination plot . . we see suffering , we see how it effects pryor and others and people in the middle of it . . there ' s no damage , esp . emotional from lex ' s plot to sink the us . we see a glob of crystal thrown into space . . superman had to get very creative in the first three supermans in order to stop the plot against him , he couldn ' t just " access " his superpowers . in the first one , he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save lois ' life . . . ( this was thirty years ago ! ! " ) in the second one , he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more powerful than , but combined with lex ' s genius , and the villains ' immoral tactics , superman ' s overpowering wasn ' t enough , he had to work one against the other and outsmart them . . . in superman iii , again , his superpowers weren ' t enough to win . . he had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw . he couldn ' t use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance , so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression . and he found that acid earlier when he couldn ' t simply use his superpowers to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire , so he had to use his superbrains - - he couldn ' t carry water , so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire . . now in superman returns , he simply lunges the island into outerspace , like a night temp for ups . he doesn ' t need to figure anything out , he just uses his " super strength " . and lex luther ' s brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk . < br / > < br / > to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face , but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasn ' t grey poupon he was looking at . 
NEG everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie ! it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie ! my grandma could have done better than that ! but that ' s not the only reason why this movie is really bad ! ( it ' s actually so bad that i ' m not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark ! ) if the first episode of  les visiteurs ' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . clavier is over - acting his role even more than in the first part , robin is trying to act like lemercier ( because she ' s replacing her ) but that ' s  grotesque ' . lemercier is lemercier , robin is robin ! even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage , she is not in this movie because she ' s not acting as she used to act . i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role ( lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie ) but she made a big mistake : instead of playing her role , she played  lemercier playing her role ' ! as for the story , it ' s just too much ! of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . the gags are repetitive , childish and déjà - vu . no , really , there ' s no more than 3 funny parts in this . the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . so you have only 2 reasons to watch it : 1 ) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie , 2 ) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a  brainless moment ' ! 2 / 10 
NEG . . . then they will have a proper place to file this crap . sorry , not a " mystery " as claimed , it is religious mumbo - jumbo . i kept waiting for the " unimaginable evil " that was promised me , but the " evil " in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities . < br / > < br / > i can ' t believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment . unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them , and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future . i ' m also a little cheesed off that i now have a writer ' s name and director ' s name to memorize as i ' ll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too . < br / > < br / > it ' s really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 , etc . will get their reviews posted first . this could lead to more people getting tricked , as i was , into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching . < br / > < br / > well , it ' s off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising . too bad they can ' t give me back the 105 minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror / supernatural film . 
NEG not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews . < br / > < br / > while watching " bang " one night on tv , i found myself bored by the nonsensical , random plot which was occurring on screen . the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless , artsy - fartsy self - indulgence on the part of the filmmaker . the fact that the director / writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness . < br / > < br / > those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say , more entertaining than this complete waste of time . 
NEG this movie was made for people who found gremlins too serious and critters to hardcore . like many of the critters / trolls / gremlins movies of the 80 ' s this movie is bad . the sad part is that there ' s no punchline to that comment . it ' s just bad and not in a funny way . < br / > < br / > the problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as howie mandell was in walk like a man . what made the other 80 ' s horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary , but were hilarious because they failed so miserably . someone must have told bettina hirsch ( yes the bettina hirsch ) she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie . unfortunately they were wrong . < br / > < br / > sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the lost boys is amusing , but not enough to save the movie . < br / > < br / > by far the most annoying part of the movie is the paul character . his paul reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guy . . . not that i did that . < br / > < br / > so the bottom line is run , don ' t walk , to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves . 
NEG munchies starts in deepest darkest peru ( looks more like a dirt road to me ) where archaeologist simon watterman ( harvey korman ) & his son paul ( charles stratton ) are on an expedition . simon thinks that ancient aztec buildings were in fact spacecraft control centres & he is on a mission to gain proof that alien lifeforms have visited earth , while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his backpack & takes back home with him to the small american town of sweetwater in california . simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for & for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery . simon ask ' s paul & his wife cindy ( nadine van der velde ) to take care of it . meanwhile simon ' s brother & fast - food businessman cecil watterman ( harvey korman again ) steals the creature so his brother won ' t make any money out of it , but his idiotic stepson dude ( jon stafford ) has a fight with it & chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the townspeople . . . < br / > < br / > directed by bettina hirsch this has to be one of the worst horror comedy ' s ever , if not the worst . the script by lance smith is so unfunny it ' s painful . every joke in munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile , i doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to pre - teens . there just isn ' t anything even remotely funny or even amusing in munchies as far as i ' m concerned . the basic story is crap too , they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is , why no - ones ever seen it before , how it manages to learn english so quickly & how it learns to drive etc . the whole thing is a big gremlins ( 1984 ) rip - off with none of the elements that made that film so good . the character ' s are moronic , the stupid deputy ( charlie phillips ) & his dad ( hardy rawls ) , cecil wearing an embarrassing wig & fake moustache & his air head wife melvis ( alix elias ) & more besides . they just plain embarrass & are ridiculous , i defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny . basically munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror & ends up being , yes you ' ve guessed it , crap . < br / > < br / > director hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows , the entire thing takes place in two houses , the desert , some caves & a miniature golf course . this is really cheap & incompetent film - making . the special effects on the munchies themselves are really awful , their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it ' s arm . i cannot stress how bad the effects are , these things wouldn ' t convince my 4 year old nephew ( as proved by me & him yesterday ! ) . total incompetence all the way , this film sucks . < br / > < br / > technically the film is terrible , bad special effects , lame production design , rubbish sets & well , just everything ' s crap . the acting is rotten through & through , from the cops to korman who has two roles both of which prove he can ' t act & isn ' t funny . < br / > < br / > munchies is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve , sure watch it if you want i won ' t stop you but just don ' t say you weren ' t warned ! my advice would be to watch gremlins again instead , but the decision is yours ! 
NEG i didn ' t expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend . it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out . still , i held out hope . it sounded a bit much like " bride and prejudice " ( l . a . guy falls for an indian beauty , parental conflict , blah blah blah ) . b & p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters . < br / > < br / > " my bollywood bride " had none of that . the acting seemed stilted and way to by - the - numbers . characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student . technically , the sound really bothered me . it seemed as if there was a lot of over - dubbing of dialogue . i mean a lot . i know sometimes it ' s necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting . < br / > < br / > two stars is being somewhat generous . 
NEG all of the x - men movies were great . and i mean all of them , including the long hated x - men 3 . they had solid characters ( magneto and xavier were the best ones , in my opinion ) , and a good story arch . < br / > < br / > i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production , and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie . i was so disappointed . < br / > < br / > hugh jackman is not a bad actor ( his best movie is the fountain , although you won ' t hear about this movie when they talk about the actor ) , and his acting is not what screws the movie up . < br / > < br / > the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot ( like blob or gambit ) , which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics . < br / > < br / > i am a fan of xmen , i have read many , many of their stories and this movie respected none of them . none . not even the continuity . it doesn ' t respect weapon x project , or the relationship between wolverine and sabretooth , or emma frost , the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies : revenge for the death of a loved one . < br / > < br / > oh . what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a berseker moment for wolverine similar to the one he has in x2 in the school when stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces , but hey , this is fox , this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero . < br / > < br / > besides , i had a feeling of constant dejá vù with this movie because wolverine ' s origins are already explained in x2 , we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know . < br / > < br / > i personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back - story because mystery is the nature of the character . do we really want to know how the joker got his scars ? 
NEG this movie should be number one on the bottom 100 . the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill . and the story is worse . i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob ' s review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet . don ' t waste your time , money , energy or anything else on this movie . thank goodness we saw it on tv so we didn ' t spend anything on it . had we , i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction . in conclusion , i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act . but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film . don ' t spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it . 
NEG we ' ve all been there , sitting with some friends watching a bad movie , laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was ; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says " how is it possible such a movie was made ? who paid money to have this script made into a feature film ? " well jigsaw is not that kind of film , instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun . yes , jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived , this coming from a guy who has seen campfire stories and fever lake . the film starts out in some kind of college class , what kind of class i am unsure , but it is imagined to be an art class . now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher , five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit , and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic a , oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free a , good for her ! a week passes and the five students , plus teacher , plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project , they put the pieces together , head , arms , legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs , now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage , one puts a saw blade in the left hand , the other gets a sawed off shotgun , the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings , the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye , ala hellraiser 3 , with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo - hawk . after they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin , now aptly named jigsaw . now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair , bad acting , dialog and everything else , but has still been pretty plausible , yet after jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst . . . jigsaw comes alive . . how you ask ? i have no idea , he just does because the writers couldn ' t think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive ( come on guys , a bolt of lighting , a traveling voodoo priest , anything could have worked . ) so once jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc . first he kills the cool guy with some barb wire , this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him . with him gone jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head , he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband ; jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception . did i mention jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself ? no ! well its not important they don ' t even show his macabre creation , they don ' t even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators ( maybe he was trying to create the head detective from in living color ) . so after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left , the teacher figures out that jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece , since he is still uninterested in that torso thing . so being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn ' t even plugged in . that is where the freaking movie ends , we don ' t even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl , let alone an explanation why jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned . this movie is so shameful it has too be seen , it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day ; for the memories of a lifetime , jigsaw , jigsaw , jigsaw . thank you total recall ! the judge has ruled , watch jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out . 
NEG paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt . it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood , and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences . < br / > < br / > unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife , a conflict over a road construction project , the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters , a mysterious man who lives in the woods , a bunch of racist hooligans , at least three different carnivals , the intricacies of local church politics , and on and on and on . and all of that doesn ' t even include the actual central plot , which is only about the hopes , dreams , and frustrations of two girls ( and their entire families ) at the turning point of their lives . i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer ( and that so much movie got accomplished in 1 . 5 hours ! ) < br / > < br / > ultimately the movie is melodramatic , every plot point is predictable , major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later . . . and some of those events are extremely distasteful . most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime ( in a totally predictable " twist " ) and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on . similarly , a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another " twist . " it ' s all totally mechanical , right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends ( well not all of them , just the ones the movie thinks you care about . ) 
NEG a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script . ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel . i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed . there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either . watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying . < br / > < br / > spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible . he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero . it has to be a mysterious virus . after the inspector says this , the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony . this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel . < br / > < br / > end spoilers overall , this movie is extremely lame . i don ' t understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none . my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film . this is a movie to avoid . 
NEG " wild tigers i have known . " it will only be showing in big cities , to be sure . it is one of those films so artsy , that it makes no sense what so ever , except to the director ! i hate those ! and all of those oh - so - alternative / artsy people try desperately to find " metaphors " in what is evident horseshit . < br / > < br / > there was no plot , no story , no moral , no chronology , and nothing amusing or even touching . to me , it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another , and were all for " show " to show how " artsy " and " visual " they could get . it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film , but missed the mark on every level humanly possible . then the credits roll ! i was waiting for it to make sense ! i was waiting for " the good part . " i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection , many of which could arguably be called " art house " films . this will not be amongst them . you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film , much less ever buying it on dvd . 
NEG despite its stereotypes , virtually ' no - name ' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright ; much better than i expected it to be . i was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me . but in the end , i thought the film handled the concept well ( even if some scenes were a little clichéd ) . < br / > < br / > the cast was quite good , and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously . i couldn ' t help thinking , though , that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look - a - like . maybe it ' s just her face or the make - up , hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time . < br / > < br / > while it ' s not a ' must see ' or a great film by any standard , ' fatal error ' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end . 
NEG i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy , which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie . they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot . besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child - porn ( which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically , i would liken this movie to a recipe that ' s been torn in half . it ' s kind of like being handed a list of ingredients , with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product . from the start , character development and story development are lacking . . . unfortunately , many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think " ahh - ok . . . finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on . . . or . . . who this character is . . . or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more . . . or understand and get involved more with this inter - character relationship . . . etc . " but no such luck ! on the contrary , many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled , only to find that whatever mini - plot within whatever mini - plot ( and that poorly presented ) was just a ruse . why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery , other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2 - 1 / 2 stars ( another mystery ) . it ' s not that the characters aren ' t likable to some degree , or that you can ' t identify with them or their humanness at all . . . it ' s just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort . i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone ' s film school project . i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half . 
NEG having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn , i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead , of all movies . haven ' t seen that one yet , but , considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever , safe to say i made the wrong choice . there is simply nothing to recommend this movie , and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut . it didn ' t even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend . it simply made no sense , held no excitement , had very little interesting acting or compelling writing . the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running , and the reason is obvious . the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly , to meaningless effect . get wrong turn instead , if you want to see dushku . i would like to see a movie with her and the super - hot elisabeth harnois - - but i don ' t think even that would have made this movie watchable . casey affleck , so promising in good will hunting , is awful here - - he seems to lack both intelligence and guts . that ' s enough on this one . 
NEG steve carpenter cannot make horror movies . first of all , the casting was very wrong for this movie . the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer . this movies has no gore ( usually a key ingredient to a horror movie ) , no action , no acting , and no suspense ( also a key ingredient ) . wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it ' s sad . there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny ( continuing the teen horror / comedy movies ) and no one laughed in the audience . i thought that this movie was rated r , and i didn ' t pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg - 13 . anyway , see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer . that ' s the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary . and seriously , this is to you steve carpenter , stop making horror movies . this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre . 
NEG this is not a very good movie , but it ' s not a stinker either . it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk . < br / > < br / > my gf and i have figured this movie out ( we think ) so here it is : < br / > < br / > * * * major spoilers below * * * < br / > < br / > firstly , this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious - dream - state junk ( 95 % of the movie . ) < br / > < br / > ignoring the junk , what really happened is this : a group of school friends go to a rave one night . they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die . that ' s the simple cut down version . ( that ' s right , i said sean , bear with me ) < br / > < br / > right after the accident , cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie . this is where the dream part starts . < br / > < br / > the movie is called soul survivors , right ? cassie ' s mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls ( annie , matt , raven , the 2 weirdos and jude ) along with images conjured up by her mind ( sean , school and everything else around her ) . the souls continue doing what they were defined as : annie the rave - going chick , the 2 weirdo - killers ( from opening scene ) , father jude still helping people etc . < br / > < br / > we are then taken on a very long ride , shown lots of images ( many of which my gf and i still can ' t tie in ) but it all boils down to it not being cassie ' s time to die . < br / > < br / > at the end , cassie wakes up in the hospital after being " dead " for a while . her family and sean are there . this is reality again . she ' s ok . < br / > < br / > then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled . but this part is really just a nightmare , and she wakes up beside sean , obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience . < br / > < br / > due to space restrictions , we didn ' t cover every little thing , but feel free to drop us an e - mail if you want to . < br / > < br / > 
NEG i saw this movie a long time ago . . . luckily it was for free . i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater . i don ' t remember a whole bunch of it , but i do remember i was incredibly bored , the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was . i just was incredibly bothered by one thing : if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive , why can ' t they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty ? how stupid do they think we are ? 
NEG oh , i heard so much good about this movie . went to see it with my best friend ( she ' s female , i ' m male ) . now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream . after the first couple of dozen " take off your clothes , " we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom . we laughed ( at it , not with it ) , we dozed ( and would have been better off staying in bed ) , we were convinced we had spent money in vain . and we had . the plot was incoherent , and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care . a waste of money , a waste of celluloid . this movie doesn ' t even deserve one out of ten votes , but that ' s the lowest available . i ' m not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent ; i don ' t recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence . 
NEG this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure , and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it , and didn ' t have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school ! admittedly , the storyline was decent . . . but i found the acting terrible ! the exception was marianne jean - baptiste , i thought her performance was wonderful . she was the only highlight , without her , i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film . every time i hear somebody say " daarling " i cringe ! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said " it " . it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life ! < br / > < br / > ( i apologise if this has offended anybody , i am only expressing my opinion ) 
NEG well , eyeboy , i must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me , especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do . my favorite part of your post was " but no big bang - bang good - guy bad - guy here , kimosabe . me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang . " < br / > < br / > well said ! i do like action movies , especially if they are well done , but i also like movies that don ' t have a whole lot of action , as long as they are well done . i ' m sorry , but secret ' s and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie . i really don ' t see very many non - american films , so maybe i was spoiled , and didn ' t realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies . perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb . hmm . . . if true , that is very scary . < br / > < br / > jeremy barger bits @ midohio . net ( new e - mail ) 
NEG ok , don ' t let my summary fool you . this movie sucks hard . but the worst movie ever ? this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn ' t have to rack their brains to describe . but it is in no way worse than manos : the hands of fate , hobgobblins , horrors of spider island , or a small handful of movies . as a review the movie sucks , it ' s terrible . don ' t see it with out mst or you may develop health problems . but there are worse movies . 
NEG i mean of all the obscure , overlooked , low budget horror movies waiting to be re - discovered in a dvd release , why pick the forest ? i love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror . i love 80s hacker horror . i love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased , murdered and eaten by psychopaths . i am all for the idea of non - professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one . i am all for using found public locations , non - actors , no name talent behind the camera and in the studio . no problem ! the most evocative image from the forest is it ' s opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods : we see them as tiny , vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator . then the film takes a dive & never recovers - - we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked . they get separated , both are butchered , and then we meet the movie ' s protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam . they meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip . sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks . < br / > < br / > this film is too slow , this movie is too boring , and this movie is too talky . which wouldn ' t be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid , asinine and unnecessary things . you know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopy - faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the cannibal woods . and speaking of these " woods " they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields , only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it . there are impressive shots of the forest primeval , but no real sense of being out in the middle of it . if any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by . < br / > < br / > what is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest : i don ' t know who these couples are and don ' t care what happens to them . the hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend , who just happens to seek shelter in his cave . the irony of which is the epitome of " underwhelming " . coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score , cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow people ' s movements , a lack of appreciable gore , nudity , lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that isn ' t even as frightening as a pbs educational tv show about how magnets work . < br / > < br / > i don ' t mean to " dish it out " to the people behind this film , since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing , did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife . there is nothing wrong with that concept , what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed , right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark . the best thing that you can say about the forest is that it is over relatively quickly and there isn ' t much to command a repeat screening - - hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a dvd release . it was fine as a prism video rental years oddity , as a dvd it will be $ 5 . 99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves . there is little or no urgency to see the film , unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there . here is a guide of steps to avoid making . < br / > < br / > with all that said and done , the film did have one interesting sequence , or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut & dried film : the madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor . he dispatches his beloved , arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper . the guy corners and attacks his quarry , who sidesteps & runs away , only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger , badder weapon . the psycho attacks again , and the guy gets away . the psycho materializes again , and once more the guy gets away . then again ! finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption . how did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that ? is there some supernatural element to this psycho ? since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma , staged to build some tension . it ' s purpose remains unclear . the whole film is like that really , existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham - fisted , uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was . < br / > < br / > 3 / 10 , and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on dvd that doesn ' t mean you necessarily should . 
NEG i went into this movie expecting it to be really god - awful . and it was . i really felt sorry for the star - studded cast - kathy bates was a wonderful actress . . . before she made this movie - vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn ' t put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for . fred ' s dad , played by trevor peacock ( of vicar of dibley fame , amongst others ) , had about one line . < br / > < br / > the plot was predictable and all over the place , and the humour was . . . lacking . ( however , there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family . . . that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic ) don ' t see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head - on collision with a train ( actually - maybe the train would be better . . . ) 
NEG painfully bad christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by vince vaughn , who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children ' s movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his r rated films . vaughn seems like he ' s on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance . after 30 minutes into the film , you would be in touch your inner scourge and say " bahumbag " at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes , you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point . out of all the actors involved in this mess , only paul giamatti and rachel weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that ' s manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film . paul giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of saint nick himself but he ' s forced to vaughn ' s level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting . you can see in giamatti face that he ' s not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film . rachel weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she ' s well aware of that , so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film . fortunately for her , she ' s not in the film much at all and is able to save some face , unlike giamatti , who looks like he ' s about to fire his agent by the end of the movie . the direction also feels uninspiring , like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down . < br / > < br / > i don ' t know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved ( giamatti and weisz ) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with , spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a christmas movie of all things ) and a actor who just does not care about his performance ( vaughn ) , you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch . 
NEG i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it ' s a mess . i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80 ' s classic " santa claus the movie " but with out the camp or the bad sheena easton song at the end . . the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting . of course fred ( vince vaughn ) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend ( rachel weisz in a cameo role ) dumping him , so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus ( paul giamatti ) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of christmas . now if you think you know the ending of this film , i think you would be right because it ' s predicable to the hill . as for the acting , vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable , miranda richardson plays mrs . claus but the role is more than less one note , elizabeth banks plays santa ' s assistant but she ' s not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film " glengarry glen ross " but a little more anal . the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul giamatti , who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can ' t blame him and rachel weisz , who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs , which is a shame because both rachel weisz and paul giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them . < br / > < br / > to put it in a nutshell , a major disappointment . 
NEG the acting , other reviews notwithstanding , was remarkably well - done . brad pitt handles the role of an annoying , obnoxious austrian climber quite well . other acting is fine . the story could have been riveting , but somehow , it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown , and so the story , which could have been quite dramatic , fails to draw in this audience . < br / > < br / > beautiful scenery and cinematography , a remarkably dramatic true story , important events that shaped the world that we live in - but i could not , try as i might , involve myself in this story . as an unabashed brad pitt fan ( i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation ) , i expected to * love * this flick - and yet , it left me cold . < br / > < br / > it could be a failing within myself , but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction , scriptwriting , production , editing - somehow , they lost me . it ' s a shame , because it could have been wonderful . < br / > < br / > good acting , dramatic story , beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent . it wasn ' t . probably worth watching , just to make your own mind up on it - but don ' t expect too much , and perhaps you won ' t be as disappointed as i was . mostly , it bored me . 
NEG stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things : action and thrills . the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task . richard widmark , edward albert , and eli wallach are his operatives - - - they presumably work for the government , but that , like most of the movie ' s plot line , is never made clear . hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere . while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view , the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom . the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it . kramer ' s direction is devoid of any style . it ' s a very sunny movie ! < br / > < br / > the acting is fine with hackman proving he ' s pretty much incapable of being bad . widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark ' s cruel lackey . even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman ' s sidekick . one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman ' s wife . we ' re told she ' s done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang . kramer ' s idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig . it ' s a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell . 
NEG do not watch this sad excuse for a film . i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p * * sed off about it . < br / > < br / > the acting is comparable with high school plays . the script is shocking . there is no plot . twenty minutes from the end ( which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching ) i had a headache from all the screaming , crying and wailing the five girls make . < br / > < br / > the majority of the violence is ( rare for a film nowadays ) suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them , and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s * * t , die in the most horrible ways possible . < br / > < br / > i spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours . don ' t do it . 
NEG the writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity . did writer ' s block set in so badly , or had ideas dried up so much , that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van , and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind ( mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth ) . we had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint , as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting ; once would have sufficed . . . we got the message ! this really is taking toilet humour to another level ! had the script and acting been better then i could have easily forgotten that i was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video . this was a fairly original storyline , with a clever ( the only ) piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van ; thus making it feel much more real . we never got to see inside any other locations , such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared , and this could have added much needed tension . < br / > < br / > the script was dire . lines like : ' i don ' t feel too good . . . i want to go home ' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath ; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at , seem a little undercooked . < br / > < br / > the acting was diabolical ( apart from the maniac ) . did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike ! the sound was so bad that i had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on . < br / > < br / > the director seemed to have an easy job in this . it seems that the only direction he must have given was : ' scream girls ' . < br / > < br / > and as for the screaming . . . . . . if you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready ! 
NEG after just watching five across the eyes , i gotta be honest . . . i just didn ' t like it . i had read so many good reviews on this movie , but i just did ' nt get where these reviews have came from , < br / > < br / > i have got a lot of time for newcomers into film - making , and i ' m sure the directors will do well for themselves , but the budget they had was the main problem , there was two cameras used in the entire film ( which was ok ) but they seemed like really cheap cameras . another problem was the sound , you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time , all talking on top of each other - it ' s just impossible to hear what they ' re saying . < br / > < br / > it had a good idea going for it , in a nutshell , they hit a parked car then drive off , a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit , driven by a mad woman , who wants to kill them , and has plenty of chances to do so ! . . . and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape , but don ' t ! < br / > < br / > very frustrating . . . i only just scraped through this one ! 
NEG yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for . this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clichéd scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one ' s love . the characters are one - dimensional caricatures save for love - hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film . things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses ; our good - natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending . if you ' re looking for a bridget jones , notting hill kind of experience you won ' t find it here . 
NEG i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie . it was an epic of adolescence , a dream of summers gone , a great potential indie film or big budget drama . it somehow got into the hands of a hack , who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and rushmore without actually learning anything at all . the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags . i feel sorry for the actors , since the characters in the book were rich and textured , but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film . mason gamble is great when given the opportunity , as is dylan baker , but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special . poor people = good , rich people = bad . < br / > < br / > though it ' s almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in delaware . < br / > < br / > it ' s a good book , but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills goodloe . < br / > < br / > k . 
NEG non existent plot , tons of poorly directed / super - cheesy scenes ( snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can ' t even hit their targets a few feet away ? plus what ' s up with the ending ? - - - > a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival ' s shooting gallery ? wth ? ) , technical mistakes ( how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock ? 100 + ? these people fire their guns without the need of reloading ) . the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn ( aliens , terminator ) can ' t save this junk . < br / > < br / > do not watch this movie ( i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one ) . hopefully the director would either stop making movies , or learn more for his next movie . 
NEG by now you should already know about this film , the jessica simpson " bomb " that pretty much went straight to video ( limited , anemic theatrical run ) . basically , ms . simpson ' s katie travels from a small town in oklahoma to visit her boyfriend , to surprise him , only to find him in bed with another woman . she is stranded , but has one friend ( rachel leigh cook , whom i wish we saw more often in film ) , who lets her stay . katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co - workers ( penelope ann miller and the always amusing andy dick ) who are just using katie to get the president of the firm ( larry miller ) ousted . this is strictly a b movie , its not meant to be profound . jessica simpson is not a great actress by any means , but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying . the film is watchable in that its not an abomination , but its throwaway fluff . in a cameo , penny marshall is funny ( a subtle in - joke about milwaukee made me chuckle ) , and there is a funny scene involving norwegian priests ( don ' t read too much into this ) . so , not horrible , but easy to skip . your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does . again , not good , but not a profound disaster . 
NEG alan rudolph is a so - so director , without that special touch . as an example , there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife . rudolph squandered it . the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices , with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms . you get the idea of their desolation and isolation , but not much more . the lighting , the colors , the body language , the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon . if i were directing , i would have spent all day , if necessary , to get that shot right . that ' s the beauty and power of film : it can express so much , whole lives , in a matter of seconds < br / > < br / > the shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on . the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle , should have stomped and shuffled her feet , should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention . < br / > < br / > campbell didn ' t deliver . he plays a uncommunicative man , true , but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice , gesture , body movement , the film relies on voice - over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter - ego , played by denis leary . 
NEG i really don ' t understand all these positive user reviews . this movie is the worst movie i ' ve ever seen and i ' m not trying to be pessimistic . < br / > < br / > eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film . but i don ' t think it is her own fault but the directors . he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial ; their acting , the idea , the make - up , everything . < br / > < br / > the star i ' m giving is only for the idea behind the movie , which was very bad executed . < br / > < br / > don ' t watch this bullshit , go watch a fellini , woody allen or some david lynch . 
NEG et ' s obsession with dannielynn smith is despicable . leave the child alone . with all the constant attention she ' ll most likely grow up psychotic , depressed or worse . think of princess diana and how she longed for privacy . now poor little rich girl ashley olson just wants to be left alone . no wonder greta garbo became a recluse and said " i want to be alone " . how much does et make off this little girl ? does et not have anything better to report on ? i bet there ' s lots of people who really don ' t care what color her birthday cake and balloons were . by the way , i never heard that anna nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance . who is paying for the lifestyle of larry , howard and little dannielynn ? could it be et ? 
NEG this show is unbelievable in that . . . what it represents and what it focuses on and . . . words cannot describe how insane et is . they will report anything . if a celebrity is even remotely indirectly connected to the story et will report on it . if a dog poop in the tom cruise ' s yard they will report on it . if a celebrity dies . . . they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envy that celebrity . if a celebrity is on trial . . . et will report it for months on end . there is no end to what this show will reports and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story . is it even considered legitimates reporting ? the reports are so dang annoying too , with harsh rambling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of important . i cannot watch this show without questioning humanity ' s existence . et is one big reason i avoid pre - evening shows in general . i regret that imdb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even in the negatives . for this show deserve - 10 stars . 
NEG entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years , but as of last night ( aug 17th 2006 ) they reached a new low . < br / > < br / > in an effort to try to hype up their broadcast , they decided to post actual photos of jonbenet ramsey ' s body in their teasers last night . . . saying " pictures from the case you have never seen before " . the two photos were graphic and very disturbing . one was of the side of her face and head / neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck , and bruising on her face . this was so hideously awful , i could not believe it . how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment ? ? nothing ! ! they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low . . . . and it shows . this used to be the premiere show to watch . . . and it ' s just garbage now . < br / > < br / > i will watch access hollywood from now on . 
NEG i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence . < br / > < br / > three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner . i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes , that alone didn ' t sit well with me . weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times . < br / > < br / > there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film . more like a 45 minute boy ' s brief short rather than a fleshed out full - length film . it had a certain erotic flair , male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts . < br / > < br / > the 1st part : boxer / stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin . bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him ? i felt as though their cat - mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion . we needed more information about them and less parking lot / locker scenes with tim relentlessly saying " what do you want ? " < br / > < br / > the 2nd part : danny wants his buddy , tony , to beat him up while he jacks - off . tony doesn ' t seem to mind , but he doesn ' t even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby - - not even after they do it in the nude . this tale lacks the all - important transition from " i ' m a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun " to " i think i might be gay and hitting him because i ' d like to spread his ass and do him s / m style . " a very important thing to leave out . < br / > < br / > clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time . the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought . furthermore , it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film . yes , the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy . the make - up ( bruises and cuts ) however was on par with a grammar school talent show . < br / > < br / > there wasn ' t enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic . the film made no statement , squandered time , and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment . its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach , that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously . 
NEG jill dunne ( played by mitzi kapture ) , is an attractive , nice woman , over - whelmed by a smart - mouthed teenage daughter , liv ( martha macisaac ) and a petty , two - timing husband , sean ( rick roberts ) , both of which were tediously self - centered , and obnoxious . < br / > < br / > this was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm . < br / > < br / > the storm doesn ' t even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film , and then it isn ' t anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar . < br / > < br / > the stalking , likewise doesn ' t get intense until almost the end of the film . < br / > < br / > most of the film we spend listening to jill and her insufferable daughter , liv , argue until i just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week . < br / > < br / > jill ' s problem with liv is that she has taken up with zack , a boy of questionable character , and they are constantly making out - - in fact jill comes home to find the two of them on liv ' s bed . < br / > < br / > the rest of the time we spend listening to jill ' s husband sean either whine at jill or criticize her . < br / > < br / > sean was not at all appealing - - since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots . < br / > < br / > the story begins with jill being notified of an out - standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to , and that she thought sean had never been to either . < br / > < br / > jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager , richard grant ( nick mancuso ) , a very nice , older , divorced man , who is sympathetic to her . in fact , when he spots her husband there again , he phones jill and tips her off . < br / > < br / > jill returns to the hotel , sees sean with another woman . she is upset , leaves without sean seeing her , and does absolutely nothing . in fact , she doesn ' t even say anything to sean when he arrives home . this made no sense to me . < br / > < br / > jill has given richard her business card , and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate . she shows him a condo . afterwards they have a drink , and things get cozy between them . < br / > < br / > richard and jill are getting it on , hot and heavy . in fact , he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary , when jill suddenly decides to cut out . < br / > < br / > jill and sean have a confrontation about his cheating . sean whines about how jill has been letting him down since her father died . apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault . eventually jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to sean - - and of course that ' s all her fault too , as far as sean is concerned . < br / > < br / > the little family decides to go on a camping trip - - which means more whining and grousing among them , especially from the spoiled daughter . < br / > < br / > i was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody , but jill . < br / > < br / > 3 stars 
NEG what ' s to like about this movie ? ? ? < br / > < br / > it is in colour ! < br / > < br / > it has some impressive underwater photography ! < br / > < br / > it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times ! < br / > < br / > so 3 out of 10 ! < br / > < br / > sometimes the music is speeded up ! especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in ! < br / > < br / > sometimes it is slowed ! as if to convey to the audience it ' s about to be time for sympathy ! < br / > < br / > as another one bites the dust ! as if in a " spagetti western " this has much similarity to ! < br / > < br / > it ' s not that the italians can ' t produce quality productions ! there was a series of tv movies with a heading like " octopus " numbered about 1 to 7 , screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia - type conflicts ! and they were excellent ! but alas , you won ' t find it here ! ! ! < br / > < br / > i assumed it was made about 1960s ! sadly it was 20 years out of date , as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end ! < br / > < br / > then there was the razor - sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters ! < br / > < br / > amidst it all , either in bar - room brawl or in observing the latest sea - side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark , the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern , as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone ' s character development ! < br / > < br / > at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly , for his ex - wife ! < br / > < br / > but of course , even if the music fails to awaken our realisation , we have the sinister sound in the baddies ' voices , as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge ! < br / > < br / > and near the end , someone thought of a twist ! just when we thought it was all totally predictable ! but stay tuned , folks , for you may find another twist ! if you are watching closely ! to , more or less , warm your heart ! < br / > < br / > follow the advice of the hero , and have a few beers along the way ! it ' ll make your viewing of " night of the sharks " more enjoyable ! < br / > < br / > then you ' ll be ready for something like a " 007 " movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over ! ! ! 
NEG the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid . at least all i lost was $ 3 . 00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb . the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat . when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location , mr . fbi handed the female a revolver . when the alleged killer came out the door , the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic . one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian ? i think not . ms . xavier appears to be a very attractive female . it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen . it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out . 
NEG dreamgirls , despite its fistful of tony wins in an incredibly weak year on broadway , has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals . however , that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on - screen . unfortunately , what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact . first , the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor . there are lots of songs ( perhaps too many ? ) , but few of them are especially memorable . the closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and one night only - the much acclaimed and i am telling you that i am not going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of effie ( jennifer hudson ) . the film is slick and technically well - produced , but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance . there is some interest in the opening moments , watching jamie foxx ' s svengali - like manager manipulate his acts to the top , but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film , when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain , despite his having been right from a business stand - point for a good majority of the film . beyonce knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well , but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz . anika noni rose as the third member of the dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film . eddie murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on james brown , but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact . foxx would seem ideal casting , but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored . the film ' s biggest selling point is surely former american idol contestant / oscar winner jennifer hudson in the central role of effie white , the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return . for me , effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie . the film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham - handedly takes her side , but i have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion . from the start , effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious , egotistical , self - centered diva , who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part . when she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude , the charges are more than well - founded , but the stage show / film seem to think effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice . even though the film tries to soften some of effie ' s harder edges to make her more likable , the charges still stand . her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that ( much like the talent card ) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable . indeed the only big effort the film makes to show effie ' s mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office , insists that the girl has " no father " and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows . in the hands of a skillful actress , the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma . unfortunately , hudson is not that actress . she sings well , but the dialog - driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments . effie ' s signature moment ( the aforementioned and i am telling you . . . number ) is well - sung by hudson , but emotionally flat in the acting department . effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament , but hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number . all in all , not quite the emotional highlight one expects . the latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver foxx into hudson ' s earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone . foxx ' s criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers , but the film ' s seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous , not to mention pretentious and condescending , particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle . the end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit , drained of emotion , energy or anything that can be described as dynamic . 
NEG this film can be judged from three viewpoints : as history , as a profile of amin , as a fictional thriller . < br / > < br / > it fails as history , it mentions in passing the coup that threw out obote , the expulsion of the asians , and has the entebbe hi - jack as background , but not in any chronologically consistent time frame . < br / > < br / > as a profile of amin it may have been interesting , because forest whitaker is incredibly good , and if this was a better film , he would get an oscar . ( he got it - which proves the oscar voters don ' t watch the films they vote on . ) it ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel , which observed amin and the history of uganda from the point of view of the doctor . it tells instead the fictitious story of the scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of amin . but the story told is the one incident that amin was probably innocent of . < br / > < br / > as a fictional thriller , there is no plot to hold it together . the beginning is taut - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel , but sets up the story . the character of the doctor is well - defined , but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result . < br / > < br / > why the doctor decides to stay in kampala is badly explained - seduced by power ? why he befriends no - one is strange . the character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable , but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of amin close at hand . the man called horse bit at the end is risible . < br / > < br / > finally in 1971 , uganda drove on the left , not right , the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the equator tusks ? ! < br / > < br / > in short - if you ' ve never heard of amin , you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate forest whitaker ' s acting , but the last hour will bore you to confusion . if you know uganda or have read the book - don ' t see the film - it will only depress you . and if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy - he wasn ' t . 
NEG as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool , however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb . even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people . what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it . what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale . the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic . the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon . the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter , flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix . dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree . seriously , you just have to wonder why this movie was made , if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes , if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing , and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars . 
NEG i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery . it was buy 2 get 2 free and i needed one more so i chose this one . horrible mistake . the box reads like it would be a really good movie . well , it starts out like it is going to be this great movie . for about 5 minutes , that is . the movie is about a young woman , laila , who gets killed trying to save her beau , jack , from a bull . laila ' s dad , cordobes , is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of . he assumes that jack killed laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull , and goes on this hunt to find him . that was the first 5 minutes that is good . what follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse . whoever wrote the script , in my opinion , had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever . jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride . i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character . you know , jesus ' mother . but , who knows , i couldn ' t make heads or tails of it . as they ' re running . . . we get to see bad guys , magical visions , ghostly encounters , flashbacks , etc . . . and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what ' s going on . needless to say , i took the movie back and exchanged it for something else . it ' s horrible i tell ya , horrible . and , there is absolutely no bull - fighting in this movie . unless you count the first minute of the movie . hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie . 
NEG this has to be , by far , the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years . when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn ' t be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films , and he was a pretty fair actor . wrong ! no one should waste their time on this film . i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don ' t feel that i missed a thing . 
NEG this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever . the acting was pathetic . jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions . at the beginning of the movie , she was supposed to be discouraged . instead , she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out . she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene . i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses , they had to pluck out her . everyone else was suffering from over - acting as well . it was flat out annoying . it was also an insult to figure skaters . jordan took a month to train , and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team . it ' s practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work . a pitiful excuse for a movie , and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating . don ' t waste your life . it doesn ' t even deserve one star . 
NEG i haven ' t seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie " moonraker " twenty years ago . i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton , but there was nothing she could do to save this beast . < br / > < br / > as a cross between " pi " , " orlando " , and " tron " , this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking . the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy . the plot was wholly unbelievable . the acting was , with the exception of swinton , amateur . the computer graphics were worse than in " tron . " timothy leary was extremely annoying . i could go on , but what ' s the point . < br / > < br / > the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it . i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud , but she most likely regrets it now . < br / > < br / > don ' t waste your money or your time on this stinker . there ' s nothing worth seeing here . 
NEG expecting a combination of scifi and period film about ada lovelace , charles babbage , the history of computers , etc , i was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history . it gives the impression that its writer ( lynn hershman - leeson ) has no real understanding of the math , technology , or history constituting the film ' s subject , but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them . this hits a sore spot with me , as i ' ve long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion , eg : emmy coer : " information waves have a half - life " , ada : " i ' m not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all " . < br / > < br / > this movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms . the only redeeming value i can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts . it ' s more likely , i think , to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic . 
NEG when we were in junior high school , some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs . it was considered funny then . but the producers , directors and cast of " semana santa " ( " angel of death " in the dvd section of your local video rental ) are adults and they are still setting them off . < br / > < br / > like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home , i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes . < br / > < br / > mira sorvino , hot in " mighty aphrodite " and other top - rated films , seems to have undersold herself to this project . her acting is non - existent , confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how " sensitive " she is to the plight of the film ' s various victims . < br / > < br / > but let me warn you - - do not be the next victim ! step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf . tbere are not many good leg shots of mira ( the only high points i could find in the film ) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality , delivering a mishmash of badly - done dialogue with embarrassing " spanish " accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production . 
NEG last week , i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings , and there was veronica mars , supposedly " the best show you ' re not watching " . < br / > < br / > well , they ' re right that you ' re not watching it . it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147 . < br / > < br / > translation : this is the lowest - rated show on any nationally broadcast network . . . and deservedly so . i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a " great " show , a " realistic look " at life and all such nonsense . the reality was otherwise . veronica mars is a bore . it ' s as unrealistic as it gets , and it richly deserves to be canceled . < br / > < br / > the only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest - rated show in memory , after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure . 
NEG songwriter robert taylor ( as terry ) is " dizzy , slap - happy " and can ' t see straight over otherworldly norma shearer ( as consuelo ) . " she makes the sun shine , even when it ' s raining , " mr . taylor explains . but , mr . taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near ms . shearer . finally , at the palm beach casino shearer frequents , taylor proclaims " i love you ! " shearer brushes him off , as she is engaged to george sanders ( as tony ) . however , to settle a gambling debt , shearer hires taylor to pose as " her cardboard lover " , to make mr . sanders jealous . < br / > < br / > this film ' s title invites the obvious and appropriate three - word review : " her cardboard movie " . it is most notable as the last film appearance for shearer , one of the biggest stars in the world from " he who gets slapped " ( 1924 , playing another consuelo ) to " the women " ( 1939 ) . to be fair , this was likely the kind of shearer film mgm believed audiences wanted to see . however , the part is unflattering . < br / > < br / > plucked and powered , taylor and shearer were better off in " the escape " ( 1940 ) . if shearer had continued , she might have become a better actress than " leading lady " ; apparently , she was no longer interested , and certainly didn ' t need the money . taylor has a great scene , reciting christina rossetti ' s " when i am dead , my dearest " while threatening to jump from shearer ' s balcony , as directed by george cukor . < br / > < br / > * * * * her cardboard lover ( 6 / 42 ) george cukor ~ norma shearer , robert taylor , george sanders 
NEG this movie got off to an interesting start . down the road however , the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals . the male lead was very good , even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax . in comparison , this is " boomerang " meets " extremities " . 
NEG the cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle . definitely not one of johns best movies . don ' t get me wrong , with any john wayne move there is always some good spots . and this one has it ' s fair share . but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn ' t live up to the aspirations it could have been . bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain . roscoe lee brown is another bright spot in the movie . the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better . this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers . < br / > < br / > this would be a good family move to watch with your children . just be aware , there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it . but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it . maybe it ' s because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work . 
NEG dead husbands is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands ` . it ` s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies i could mention but it never fufils its potential . imagine how good this could have been if we had the farrelly brothers directing ben stiller in the role of carter elson . < br / > < br / > oh is carter based on jerry springer ? just curious because the catch phrase on dr elson ` s show is " look after each other and keep talking " 
NEG ok , where do we start with this little gem ? mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england ( ? ) town . only one man can stop them . . . and that man . . . is mike brady ! now , if that wasn ' t laughable enough , stay tuned . < br / > < br / > the footage of the slugs is what ' s known as stock footage . no matter who the slugs attack or where they are , the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown . keep in mind , this singular shot occupies at least half the movie . < br / > < br / > the acting in the movie was knock down , drag out , steal your wallet , punch your girlfriend , kill your dog , bad . i ' m sure there ' s worse , but you ' re going to be hard pressed to find it . the only gem was . . . you guessed it . . . . mike brady ! he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca , because he was the best in the bunch . < br / > < br / > as for horror ? this film is not to be taken seriously . there isn ' t horror ! they ' re slugs for crying out loud . the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two . only watch this film in a mst3k type environment , otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain . 
NEG as much as i love rodney dangerfield , this was a terrible movie . the plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies , but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes . in addition it was annoying and boring and that ' s being kind . if you ' re looking for a good laugh , rent a copy of private parts . 
NEG since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along , there ' s been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry . don ' t believe it . the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass . running out of time 2 is a perfect example . ekin cheng is the name draw , here , but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin . he flips the coin over and over and again and again . why ? who knows ? sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin - flipping pretty boy . but once again : who knows why ? there ' s a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera . nothing makes any sense . there is no action . there is no sex . there is no comedy . all there is is a name : ekin cheng . and you know what ? who cares ? 
NEG action , violence , sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie . and everything they do is done without reason . mark l . lester is ( un ) known for his violent ( without reason ) movies ( commando , the base ) . the story is weird but stupid . the actors play their stupid characters very well . . . i ' m not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors . it ' s another low - budget unknown b series action movie . if you saw something like operation delta force , drive , the patriot , sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than misbegotten . . . don ' t rent it . . . and , by the way , don ' t rent any of the movies i mentioned . . . . i give it 1and a half out of5 . 
NEG well , basically , the movie blows ! it ' s blair witch meets sean penn ' s ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the " war on terror " is really about . the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader ( no offense to 8th graders ) ; the two main actors over - act the entire film ; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film ( not that i know anything about those things - - but it just didn ' t look like real documentaries i ' ve watched ) , and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck . it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd . i ' d rather watch the blair witch viii , than sit through that again . 
NEG now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end . first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire ' s brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog . now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three - legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you ? and heres another point for pondering , why do they show the dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water ? i believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2 . 6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall , that was a heart breaker . but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death . but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e . v . i . l corporation . and let ' s not forget the characters let ' s see we have jerk off # 1 as the male lead and half way decent chick ( who doesn ' t know how to act ) as the female lead to that i say wow ! the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with . all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs ( otherwise it wouldn ' t have been made for the military duh ! ) . by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire ' s brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add . i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc . and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living . 
NEG imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie , the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid - friendly . or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn ' t cuss so that his specials could be rated pg . in the same way , the director of the movie " something wicked this way comes " took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . in trying to make the story of " something wicked this way comes " easier for children to follow , the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone , and good always prevailing over evil . this is apparent in will ' s character transformation , charles halloway ' s rescue of jim , and the carnival ' s defeat . < br / > < br / > will ' s transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . the scene in which the dust witch visits will ' s house in a balloon has been cut from the film . instead , a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders . the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . he gets on top of a neighbor ' s roof and tears the balloon with a bow , defeating the witch . " sorry , dad , he thought , and sat up , smiling . this time it ' s me out , alone , " will decides as he prepares to face her ( 147 . ) removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome . the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim , but never growing curious like his friend . in the book , will has both a good , quiet side and an " evil , " daring side like his jim . in the movie , each boy only has one mode of thought , which destroys bradbury ' s theme of both good and evil being present in each person . < br / > < br / > in the book , will saves jim because of their friendship , but , in the movie , charles halloway saves jim to repay jim ' s father . will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury ' s novel because he doesn ' t want his best friend to grow up without him . it is the good in will , the fact that he cares about his friend , that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival . on the carousel , jim " gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind , the one part of him , the small , white , separate part that still remembered their friendship " ( 269 . ) this shows that there was good left inside of jim , which has the potential to still defeat evil . but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie , he does it to repay the debt he owes jim ' s father , who saved will when he was a little boy . by changing the motivation for saving jim , the filmmakers have ruined bradbury ' s original idea that it takes good to win against evil . < br / > < br / > in the end of the movie , the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . when the book ends , mr . dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can ' t stand it and evaporates . in bradbury ' s world , evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . his message is that good will always prevail over evil , but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly . " good to evil seems evil , " says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr . dark . " so i will do only good to you , jed . i ' ll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself " ( 275 . ) in the movie , mr . dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it , and he dies . by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles , the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil , as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . this takes away the major theme of bradbury ' s book , which is that doing " good " toward others wards off evil . < br / > < br / > good may always triumph over evil , but trying to make movies more kid - friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . in the movie , " something wicked this way comes , " will does not transform , will ' s friendship does not save jim , and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . as a result , the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury ' s main points . the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . in the case of this story , bradbury ' s frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer , simpler version of itself . 
NEG most action films are crass of hindi cinema , especially of sunny and his family < br / > < br / > the film is typical sunny type with bashes , big dialogues and melodrama < br / > < br / > the film also has typical rajiv rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villain < br / > < br / > the starting is okay and then the shift to kenya is good but then the film goes on and on < br / > < br / > the sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happens < br / > < br / > they are many stupid scenes like the kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially sharat < br / > < br / > the climax too is prolonged < br / > < br / > rajiv rai does an okay job music is okay , only 1 song works and that is the last toofan camera - work is good < br / > < br / > sunny deol is as usual , chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable , naseer is alright heroines are pure wood amrish puri is not even half as scary as he was in tridev the rest are okay 
NEG after watching " the bodyguard " last night , i felt compelled to write a review of it . < br / > < br / > this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera - work . it was beyond annoying . the angles were all wrong , it was impossible to see anything , especially during the fight sequences . the closeups were even horrible . < br / > < br / > the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring . he is approached by judy lee , who is never quite straight with chiba . lee ' s involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought , as the mob and another gang of thugs are after her . < br / > < br / > the story was decent , and despite horrible dubbing , this could have been a good movie . given better direction and editing , i ' m sure this would have been a classic kung foo movie . as it is , it ' s more like another cheesy 70 ' s action movie . < br / > < br / > note : the opening sequence has a quote familiar to " pulp fiction " fans , and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie . < br / > < br / > rating : 4 out of 10 
NEG where to start . . . if this movie had been a dark comedy , i would say it was fannn - tastic ! unfortunately for me , and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare ( mind you that was the price i paid , got it from wal - mart ) , this movie was meant to be a thriller . the only thrill i got was watching kirkland ' s lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area . if you want a good laugh , on a rainy friday night with some friends , then i highly recommend this movie . but if you want to watch something at least half way decent , then don ' t even bother . < br / > < br / > i for one enjoy crappy films , the worse the better in most cases . but wow . . . i meant wow ! ! the only person in the entire film that didn ' t stink it up was the little boy , played by vincent berry . the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do . 
NEG let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970 ' s . seriously . this one was downright awful . < br / > < br / > there are way too many elements that martino tries to inject and none of them work ( except for the croc - gone - wild thing ) very well at all . there are some ignorant westerners , of course , who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere . i don ' t even remember where it takes place . . . how sad is that . . . basically , people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ' ceremonies but eventually they upset the ' alligator god ' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage , killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well . sounds good , yeah ? well , don ' t get your hopes up . there is minimal violence until the end , the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable . < br / > < br / > there is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator , like a dart , into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking . i ' m not kidding . in another wonderfully crafted special effect , a matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator , who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van . ( a few minutes ago , he was only big enough to eat a human , but now he dwarfs a full - size cargo van . . . ) it is really pathetic . the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno mattei ' s masterpiece , " rats , " what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who couldn ' t be terrified . < br / > < br / > normally i ' d say anything sergio martino was a solid must - see but this one is a must - pass . waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + sticker price from no shame . this one is a shame . < br / > < br / > 2 out of 10 , kids . 
NEG obvious attack on microsoft made by people who don ' t appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally . < br / > < br / > loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates , and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left . < br / > < br / > while microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times , it ' s unlikely they actually murder people . therefore , the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning . < br / > < br / > the " deeper " point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public , and not subject to intellectual property laws . however , this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives ( and rewards ) provided by intellectual property . < br / > < br / > it ' s one thing to be opposed to anti - competitive conduct - - that ' s common sense . it ' s quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place , which is what the film ' s mantra ( " knowledge belongs to mankind " ) represents . < br / > < br / > yet another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality . 
NEG i have read all of the love come softly books . knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book , but generally they at least have the main point of the book . i was highly disappointed in this movie . the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy ' s father comes to visit , ( although in the book both parents come ) . that is all . the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes , sad , from the book , that i just couldn ' t enjoy it . even if i didn ' t read the book it was too sad . i do know that pioneer life was rough , but the whole movie was a downer . the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great . 
NEG michael keaton has really never been a good actor ; in the tim burton batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains . here , he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living . . . < br / > < br / > well , this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller , but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you . because there ' s way too much stuff that ends up unexplained , undiscovered and uninteresting . so where ' s the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that white noise makes a fool out of itself ? truly bad acting and horrifying edited , this movie is nothing to watch . michael keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever . 
NEG jonathan rivers ( michael keaton ) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies . soon after , he ' s approached by a dr . price , an expert in electronic voice phenomena ( evp ) , who claims he ' s been receiving messages from jonathan ' s departed wife anna via sundry electronic gadgets . is anna trying to tell jonathan something ? is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale ? it ' s good to see keaton in a leading role , but the story he ' s stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points ; it ' s as if the movie doesn ' t know how to answer any of the questions it brings up , so it just distracts the viewer with new , unrelated questions . < br / > < br / > keaton himself is pretty good , convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife . he ' s matured quite a bit as an actor , leaving behind the frat - friendly waacky - hijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier . he looks a little craggy , with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect , but he ' s lost none of the guile and panache that he ' s shown during his quarter century in hollywood . < br / > < br / > so it ' s not that keaton turns in a mediocre performance , it ' s that the script itself is subpar . written by niall johnson , the plot gets more confusing as it progresses , each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path . this is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement , something that ties more or less everything together and explains . . . something . but not white noise ; i knew less about what had happened to jonathan than i did before i ' d first seen him . < br / > < br / > keaton ' s really the only reason to watch this junk , although he gets fine support from ian mcneice ( as dr . price ) and deborah kara unger as the requisite love interest . 
NEG i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie . the only thing i did see was quentin tarantino ' s seeming insane obsession for it . . . there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality . overall however , i found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous . the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and dizzying , even sickening . overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the u . s . military against various malcontents . < br / > < br / > the various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and " conclusions . " a depressing movie ( not a true _film_ , a term i reserve for true art ) that left me with a bad feeling . do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a " romantic comedy " though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content , form , and conclusion any association with this genre . < br / > < br / > i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources . 
NEG a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film . the " blonde wig " half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self - indulgence by its makers . < br / > < br / > the wong faye half ( featuring a very playful , if karen carpenter looking , faye wong ) holds much more appeal . all the ingredients are there , however , the girl - meets - boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness . character development is uneven . emotion is missing . < br / > < br / > for music lovers , wong faye ' s " mung jung yun " ( cantonese version of the cranberry ' s smash hit " dreams " ) is used effectively in chungking express . faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called " zhen tuo . " both are on cd , although only " mung jung yun " is found on the official movie soundtrack cd . 
NEG i chose " dead creatures " because i thought it was a zombies movie just like " 28 days " or so . . . but not at all . it isn ' t even a horror movie . nothing happens , except for a group of women that seem to have been infected by a strange virus that make her to eat human flesh in order to survive . < br / > < br / > that plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism . . . < br / > < br / > very very bad movie . < br / > < br / > * my rate : 2 / 10 < br / > < br / > - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - < br / > < br / > - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NEG going into a movie like i this , i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills . . . . . what i got was even less . < br / > < br / > christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit . horrified , he runs up the stairs and cuts himself . the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe . . . . . cept for the fact he ' s obsessed with santa . after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane , dressing up like santa and starts killing non - santa believing patrons and his boss . an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they ' re about to torch him , he drives his van off a cliff . . . . . into the moon . not the best ending i ' ve seen but it was original . < br / > < br / > it was a slow paced , boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers . there was hardly any gore and even the " sex " scenes were toned down . < br / > < br / > too boring . . . . . . 4 out of 10 
NEG stewart kane ( gabriel byrne , vanity fair ) heads out with his local jindabyne , australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest , recreation , and relaxation . but when stewart discovers an aboriginal woman ' s body floating face - down in a river , things appear to have turned out for the worst . the largest casualty of the weekend is the men ' s commonsense . they don ' t hike out of the ravine , and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches . then they head out and report the body . < br / > < br / > the town and the men ' s lives quickly turn into a mess . the local media swarms them , and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives . stewart ' s wife claire ( laura linney , the exorcism of emily rose ) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did , but has to battle with it through her own mental illness . < br / > < br / > amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle , splayed out on a morgue slab . her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of jindabyne : a division of men and women , black and white , social and outcast . < br / > < br / > the only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids : stewart and claire ' s son who is being led around by a half - breed aussie who ' s mother was killed also just a few years before . the young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can , and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this ( again , the underlying current of jindabyne is surmised ) . < br / > < br / > everything and everyone in this jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface , yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around ( the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of jindabyne under its surface ) . none , that is , until claire forces them to . < br / > < br / > the movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted . there are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn ' t get done ; too many loose threads . the acting was okay , but the filming was terrible . wobbly cameras , grainy or dark shots , and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production . < br / > < br / > i enjoy symbolic films , northfork being one of my all - time favorites in that vein . but jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems , which simply didn ' t happen . 
NEG there was some truth to this movie . i remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished . i also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse ( or some such charge ) . i ' m not sure if it was in australia . the viewers outside of australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders . wolf creek and this film would encourage this perception . the film itself reminded me of a simple plan . but as far a being one of the best australian films ever , as someone claimed , i can ' t be that generous . put it this way , i wouldn ' t bother watching it again . 
NEG this isn ' t art , it ' s inner - urban , politically - correct propaganda ! jindabyne ' s political intolerance is beyond unforgivable . . . it doesn ' t see people as individuals , but rather , as members of categories . < br / > < br / > this is the most patronisingly offensive australian movie i can recall ever ( and it ' s up against some pretty stiff competition ! ) . a message movie , every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there : aborigines are victims ; white men are violent or alcoholics ; white women aren ' t that bad - particularly if they are lesbians - but they ' re most likely of a depressive nature . < br / > < br / > four men who go away fishing , find the body of a murdered woman ( aboriginal , naturally ) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout . it ' s a strange decision taken with almost no discussion , as if the men are animals . the one man who briefly demurs is the goodie . . . we know this because he ' s living with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his baby a lot - and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location ( away from all these beastly bush - dwellers ) . < br / > < br / > this is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within . it ' s ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt . the film is shot through with long - distance views of the bush backed by foreboding , mysterious music . it ' s made very clear by the end that aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape . it concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black - white reconciliation . < br / > < br / > in jindabyne , country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other australians . < br / > < br / > this film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the government ' s film finance corporation . it ' s a product of the artsy set , that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects ( which are as detached from real life as possible ) , as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see . it doesn ' t matter if the film is a stinker , they still get paid . < br / > < br / > spare yourself from wasting time , avoid it like the plague . more jaded social commentary than actual entertainment , this film deserves to pan ! 
NEG i watched this knowing almost nothing about it , other than the brief description i read here . after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish , then i looked at the other stuff he ' s done to see if this was his first or second movie , but no , he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com . he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one . < br / > < br / > the story was pretty awful too , could someone just fall in love with a girl because she ' s pretty but has the mind of a child ? i gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible . 
NEG after watching this , i had lost a little respect for christopher lee ( this has passed over time ) . this film was utter garbage . first , they tried to recreate the ending from the first " howling , " with incredibly bad make - up . then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film ! the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful ! ! ! ! a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film ( from the look of it , it was supposed to be dee wallace stone ) teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves , lead by sybil danning , who seems to be naked all the time . < br / > < br / > this is not even worth renting ( unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity . ) . try to catch it on cable instead . it would be so chopped up , it may actually make sense . 
NEG to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight ( 1939 & 1944 ) via les diaboliques ( 1954 ) ; while still watchable in itself , it ' s so cliché - ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however , thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s , even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - cliff robertson ( as the conniving husband ) , jean simmons ( in the title role ) , jenny agutter ( as robertson ' s artist half - sister ) , simon ward ( as the enigmatic chauffeur ) , ron moody ( as an ill - fated doctor ) , michael jayston ( as robertson ' s business partner ) , judy geeson ( as simmons ' best friend and jayston ' s wife ) , flora robson ( as the housekeeper ) , david tomlinson ( as the notary reading simmons ' will ) and , most surprisingly perhaps , jack warner ( as a gravestone sculptor ) - although most of them actually have nothing parts , i ' m sorry to say ! 
NEG . . . thankfully he hasn ' t , yet ! this is crude , simplistic student politics made into drama . it needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits . conceit 1 : that a british electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left . conceit 2 : that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister ' s only critics are sinister civil servants , mi5 , big business and the americans ( naturally ) . conceit 3 : that this radical socialist pm can solve all union , economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation . conceit 4 : that severing all ties with the us and nato is a good thing . conceit 5 : that the soviet union isn ' t a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80 ' s . and finally , conceit 6 : that the reactionary forces of the us would actively seek to launch a coup d ' etat against britain . < br / > < br / > it ' s ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti - thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its praises . when it was made , television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience . ray mcinally ' s performance was great , which is one of the few plus points . history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show . 
NEG . . . but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time . and that takes some doing , what with the likes of various lifetime efforts . don ' t get me wrong - - i have nothing against cicely tyson . i ' ve enjoyed her tremendously in other roles ( look at sipsey in fried green tomatoes , for example ) . but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery . and chew it she does , with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim tying into a christmas goose . < br / > < br / > give me the classics anytime : alastair sim , 1951 . with the exception maybe of scrooged , all the others are just over - the - top efforts to grasp the past , present , or future spirit of christmas . 
NEG ( i ' ll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin . ) my dissatisfaction is split : 30 % tone - deafness , 70 % lackluster writing . < br / > < br / > the 30 % : i agree with the first commenter ' s synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories . i was surprised how , this film , at best , woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it ' s inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl ( this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl ) . a few minority characters are written into the stories , but they are included by obligation , while we can see the gears under the film so clearly , striving to " be diverse " but falling ever - so - short . < br / > < br / > the 70 % is why everything falls short . all characters , white plus a few token minorities , are one - dimensional , cardboard cutouts of people concepts . worse , their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i ' d say is a " gag " : we get a basic conceit , then some punchline intended to be a clever twist . but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say , " okay , that was a surprise " . . . the stories are still not that interesting , because they , too , are shallow . when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending , you ' re writing jokes . < br / > < br / > spoilers below . . . < br / > < br / > the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories . that ' s fine . but romance is amazing , deep , sometimes complex . these " romantic " stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other . words exchange , thoughts are projected through voice - over , but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another . < br / > < br / > meaning , there is no seduction ( in the broad sense ) , no tension , and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other . the only story involving a superficial " seduction " is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ( ethan hawke ) gets outwitted by the girl he ' s hitting on , who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker . sure , his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we ' d be if we were next to them , but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of " a then b " . so it unfolds , if something like a postcard could " unfold " , with all the other tales as well : a then b - - that ' s it , the only point being that these happen to occur " on set " in manhattan . by the way , the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch ; the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village . < br / > < br / > it ' s easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race , gender , sexual orientation , and so on . _new york , i love you_ , however , deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title . we expect to see the real new york , and real new yorkers , but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic , its characters flown in from the o . c . , plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity . but when we look closer at who those characters are , the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent . < br / > < br / > for example , the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park , who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny ( male nanny ) when in fact he ' s the father . notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic - construction point of view ( it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend / stepfather are strutting the girl away ) , it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl ' s father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer . what , the dad can ' t be just some guy from south america ? now that he ' s obviously hot , is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle - to - upper - class white woman ? are we that naive as to require such ? as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable . < br / > < br / > it ' s not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone . but in every conceivable set - up and plot twist , the direction taken screams status quo , appeals to safety . all these stories could have been made more interesting , even if we were forced to keep the single - dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them , at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes . asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy ? how ' bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead . again , i ' m not saying the entire conceit has to be changed . it ' s just that every . damn . story premise . is so hackneyed - - and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york , outside the trite . the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading . < br / > < br / > i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack , the good pacing of the movie ( even if what was being paced was , well , dredge ) , and the general feel of many of the scenes . the movie was just fine to sit through , and i wouldn ' t dissuade anyone from doing so . however , it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non - superficiality is when the old opera singer says ( paraphrased ) " that ' s what i love about new york : everyone ' s from a different place . " well , you wouldn ' t know it from watching this one . 
NEG john wayne & albert dekker compete for oil rights on indian territory , and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of utah , usa . < br / > < br / > an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting , with wayne & dekker playing the old and new factions of the west . it ' s based on a story by thomson burtis who co - writes the script along with eleanore griffin and ethel hill . albert rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career . a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third , where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse . the light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn ' t sit quite right , and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work . but hey , stunt men deserve their moment of glory always . solid support comes from george ' gabby ' hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma , particularly when rattling off his pistol . but in spite of its better than usual republic budget , it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne enthusiasts . 4 / 10 
NEG i saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book , and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one . i think it was the latter . first of all , it was inaccurate in many small , yet important details . one of the first things i noticed was , during winston ' s day to day life in his work , his conversations , eating in the cafeteria , etc . he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear . one of the most important parts of the book , was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face at any moment . this is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions . in the book winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip . while in the movie , he does it so often and without fear , that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat . < br / > < br / > other minor inaccuracies included winston hiding his diary in the wall , yes a very small change , but it begs the question , what ' s the point ? there was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book , and that is morphing characters . < br / > < br / > the large inaccuracies were far more disturbing , however . first of all , one of the important pieces of the book is that big brother is a government based on an intelligent , yet crude philosophy . in the movie , they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by hitler with technology . which is true , in a sense , when directed with its facism , but if that ' s all you get out of big brother , you really missed the point of the book . the terrifying thing about big brother is that , in a way , it has some points behind its philosophy . when o ' brien is picking at winstons mind in the ministry of love , he is listening to everything winston says against big brother . the fact that he listens , and advances forward in his philosophy , is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing . in the end , ( careful spoiler ahead ) when winston says he loves big brother , the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this , or the actual power behind the philosophy . i am in no way saying that the big brother ' s philosophy has points that appeal to me , but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing . < br / > < br / > also , how could anyone feel any connection between julia and winston in the film ? it was awful , no connection whatsoever . < br / > < br / > and where was o ' brien before he gave winston his address ? one of the things that carried the book was winstons thoughts about o ' brien before he made contact with him . in the movie , they just jump the gun . < br / > < br / > but that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption : because its impossible not to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours . how could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours ? at the very least , the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections . anything less is just pointless . < br / > < br / > if you loved the book , and i mean truly adored it , you will not approve of this movie , and chances are , you already knew you wouldn ' t . because the book is unfilmable , and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film . < br / > < br / > two stars out of ten 
NEG the original " cube " is a fantastic b - movie rich with paranoia , meaty characterization , and fine over - the - top performances . it ' s creepy , cryptic , and cool . and it stands perfectly well , on its own , without a stupid sequel like " cube zero . " < br / > < br / > this third ( ! ) film in the cube series is part retread ( most of the booby traps are sadly recycled ) , part aberration . it takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first movie - but , since said explanation is bland , i ' d rather it was kept a secret . there are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube , but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political - religious totalitarian state . so , what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused . < br / > < br / > what works ? basically nothing . the acting is purely amateur hour , the pacing is slow ( how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen ? ) , and the gore effects , while revolting , fail to convince . in short , " cube zero " reminded me of a " cube " fan - fic , a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel . 
NEG the first cube movie was an art movie . it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented , and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn ' t understand . it was , on the non - literal level , a " man vs . cruel nature " plot , where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end , triumphing to face a new , indefinable world beyond man ' s petty squabbles ; a world where there were no more struggle , but peace . i rated cube a 10 out of 10 , and it ' s a movie that was never meant to have any sequels . < br / > < br / > the second movie , hypercube was a massive disappointment . some of the ideas were kind of cool , but in the context of the original movie , both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning . still , for being fairly entertaining , i rated it a 5 out of 10 . < br / > < br / > the third movie , cube zero , while ignoring the second , plays like a vastly inferior commercial b - movie rehash of the first , sans the symbolism . there is no " homage " or " tribute " here ; there is only ripping off . the same kind of plot , with some elements idiotically altered ( like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip - off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say ) . < br / > < br / > that we see something from " behind the scenes " means nothing , because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment , the architects of which we hear nothing of . and , in this movie , those who get through to the exit ( like kazan did at the end of the first movie ) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that ? ! that ' s just flippin ' stupid . i ' m glad i didn ' t pay to see this . < br / > < br / > the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad , but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10 . 
NEG following the release of cube 2 : hypercube ( 2003 ) , and playing off the alleged success of the original cube ( 1998 ) , director ernie barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy , the prequel cube zero . < br / > < br / > deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution , time and place unknown , two low - ranking operators , wynn ( zachary bennett ) and dodd ( david huband ) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers , some of which are rigged with death traps . told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection , these observers have had no problem with their jobs until wynn , a mathematical genius , discovers that one of the prisoners , a woman named cassandra ( stephanie moore ) never agreed to be put inside the cube . suddenly it ' s realized that perhaps their " jobs " are not what they seem , and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted . . . < br / > < br / > for people that have seen and enjoyed the original cube , this prequel will probably not be to your liking . it ' s not that the story does not have potential ; it ' s simply that the first cube film never needed to be expanded on . standing alone , it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message . it was also nicely self - contained . the problem with cube zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original , attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing . < br / > < br / > what this new film has to offer , which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil , certainly are good questions to be raised , but probably should have been done so on their own merits , rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations . < br / > < br / > having said this , the other traits of the film , such as acting and direction and writing , are not awful . there is a bleak , dark look to the film akin to such film noir as ' the matrix ' and ' dark city ' , and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube . unfortunately for barbarash , these are not enough positive qualities to save it . 
NEG previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm , but it was a severe disappointment . lupe valdez is great , but doesn ' t get enough screen time . frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters , but the script leaves them stranded . < br / > < br / > the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy ' s character , who is at best a self - centered , physically and verbally abusive jerk . the reactions of " the public " are poorly thought - out and unbelievable , making the " shenanigans " seem like contrivances of a bad writer . and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him . < br / > < br / > the " stinging one - liners " mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer , since i didn ' t even notice that an attempt was being made . 
NEG there are some good things about the movie . the music and cinematography is great . alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance . ryan bauer is also hot . the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie . jonny vincent ( sean ) and a lot of the boys in the movie that don ' t speak are cute too . why isn ' t the actress who plays amy listed in the credits ? brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as clitarissa pink . < br / > < br / > the worse thing about the movie is probably the star , james townsend . he can ' t act . he ' s also very scrawny , not nice to look at at all . his arms are like spaghetti . it ' s disgusting . they have no muscle tone at all . it ' s no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it . no one else would cast him in anything . < br / > < br / > james townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay . they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what ' s best for the movie . then again , maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft - core porn , definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons . plus , anyone who does porn is blacklisted in hollywood . < br / > < br / > the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan - skinned latina as devon ' s mother . sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all . all in all , this movie is soft - core porn and is no better than something you would see on skinemax . i think even alex wilson , probably the best thing about this movie , is embarrassed by it and doesn ' t want to be associated with it . there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed , so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name . plus , i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie , he just turned around and walked away . i understand . if i had worked on this movie , i would be embarrassed and wouldn ' t want to be associated with it either . 
NEG nothing could have saved this movie , not even superman . < br / > < br / > ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing . better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors . but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it . plot holes , bad lines , terrible pacing , endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways . . . ugh . < br / > < br / > avoid this one at all costs . < br / > < br / > 
NEG what a dreadful movie ! for some reason , scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby , dirty , mean - spirited , misanthropes living inside . these folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a cgi dragon . spoilers : an extra - nasty scientist whose main acting skill is " leering " and " the sinister stare " has cloned a dragon . while the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing , the other scientists are shocked , because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down . the rest of the story is like the thing , or ten little indians , where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the " dragon . " the cgi dragon creature is dark gray , which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap cgi special effects . it hardly looks better than a cartoon , and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the dragon . all it looks like is a gray blob . the acting is less than horrible . these scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything , and this makes it easier for the dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape , hide , etc . dean cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie . he seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast . this movie is really , really atrocious . the acting is bad . the story is dumb . the cgi is very very cheap and amateurish . there is nothing commendable about this movie , it is not even a good time - killer to glance at while doing chores or other work . 
NEG when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member , you know you ' re in for a bad ride . < br / > < br / > i went in with very , very low expectations , having read some of the other comments , and was not let down . unlike some other cheap and failed movies , however , this one doesn ' t really remain hilariously ( and unintentionally ) funny throughout . < br / > < br / > - spoilers follow - < br / > < br / > first of all , plot it very inconsistent . looking past the " small " mistakes , such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours , the whole idea it ' s based on is messed up . see , the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs . after explaining this , they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out . later , the obligatory " crazy scientist " guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs . so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were , or we just have a fine little plot hole here . the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force " half as strong " as what was used for hiroshima . then two guys later walk in to check everything out , and it ' s almost unscathed ! there ' s even another dragon , which grew out of who knows what . all in all it ' s very predictable . as soon as the guy mentioned cloning , i guessed they ' d clone a dragon . that means that our mr . smarty - pants security guy isn ' t so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe , if you ignore that i knew this film would be about , you know , dragons . < br / > < br / > putting that aside , the second worst thing is the " special effects . " others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning , the cg helicopter , and the dragon . it looks a bit better than a blob , but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time . to their credit , the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away ( although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie . ) these things are funny to watch , however . the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not . nor are the " introduction " screens with the vital stats . < br / > < br / > coming to the actors , they weren ' t the greatest , but i guess at least they tried ? they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent " bloodrayne , " for example , and you ' ve got to give them points for that . one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in make - up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her . she looked like she had a bad run - in with some white - face . < br / > < br / > the script is bad and cheesy . you don ' t really notice the music , but it ' s actually not too bad for the most part . < br / > < br / > the bottom line is don ' t watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it ' s bad ( like i did ) , although the only funny things are the bad cg effects . other than that , don ' t waste your time and money . 
NEG there are those movies that are bad they are funny , then there are those where you scream " i want that one and a half hours of my life back " . . . thats pretty much what this is . < br / > < br / > dean cain tries to be an actor but fails . the sfx are really bad ( repeated scenes and rocks that look like falling paper ) and the fake plastic guns that have torches taped on them . . . the split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just terrible . < br / > < br / > this movie cant even be used as one of those simple night entertainers , its just that bad < br / > < br / > if i could go negative ratings , i would 
NEG the first 45 minutes of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable . the characters are believable and interesting . the cloning lab looks really high - tech . after that , it all collapses . the characters start behaving idiotically , and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor ( and this is supposedly " present day " ) going critical , the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it doesn ' t . the finish is incredibly weak . one wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong . < br / > < br / > all the characters except dean cain are played by russians . this results in some weird situations and details , like the character being played by vessela dimitrova being called " bailey kent " despite her heavy accent ( and despite her , on one occasion , inexplicably switching to * spanish * ! ) . < br / > < br / > because of the decent start , i considered rating this movie a 5 , but it really was more disappointing than that , so i only give it 4 . 
NEG i caught this movie on sci - fi before heading into work . if you ' ve any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times , this movie is for you . if that doesn ' t peak your interest , well , i ' m afraid you ' ll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames , because this movie is pretty bad . the acting , to begin with , is awful , awful , awful . the characters are all completely obnoxious , and the dialogue is worse than your typical z - grade , sci - fi movie . towards the end , the movie began to remind me of ' hollow man ' ( complete with escape via elevator shaft ) , except with a dragon , not a naked , invisible man . unlike other similar flicks , however , this one wasn ' t even awesomely bad . . . it was just plain bad . 
NEG i just watched this movie and i ' ve gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there ! ! ! a friend lent me this movie and i watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story . < br / > < br / > well , the movie started off with kevin costner as a fighter pilot retiring . . . why ? why did they make him a fighter pilot ? he was supposedly going to be hired by anthony quinn ' s character to be his new pilot . . . well , we never see costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie ! < br / > < br / > costner runs into a texan ( james gammon ) selling a horse to a big mexican businessman and costner tags along for a ride . without knowing what happened , gammon is beat to near death and costner drives him to the meeting , which happens to be with an associate of quinn ! but , nothing comes of it . . . nada , zilcho ! why did they have gammon ' s character ? why did they have the horse sale with the quinn associate if nothing was to come of it ? < br / > < br / > also , after they leave costner for dead , they make madeline stowe ' s character become a whore , then she attacks one of quinn ' s men that was paying for a turn . . . she stabs him with his own knife , and the next thing she ' s been moved to a convent ! no explanation as to why she was moved , or when it was done ! < br / > < br / > too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing ! ! i only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it . . . i ' m going to throw it at him for the 2 hours i wasted of my life watching the blasted thing ! 
NEG this movie wastes virtually every actor ' s talents in what could best be charitably called a " potboiler " . < br / > < br / > despite it ' s action - packed ' top gun ' opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn . < br / > < br / > there are so many dead - end story lines in this movie i was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded tv series . < br / > < br / > quinn ' s mexican drug - lord role is laughable and his ' associates ' plucked right out of a 1970 ' s quinn - martin cop show . costner ' s character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with mendez ' wife . nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming along . < br / > < br / > definitely a ' b ' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved . 
NEG a noble effort , i guess , but ultimately a poor one . before seeing this film , i felt " bartleby , the scrivener " was unfilmable . after seeing it , i still do . unfortunately , i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on , and they will be upset at the film ' s needless revisions ( updating from 1850 to 1970 , moving from new york to london ) . even the superb talents of paul scofield can ' t salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melville ' s metaphysical classic . 
NEG i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son . he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did . the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / disney excursion . in fact , i had a very hard time paying attention at all . the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out . < br / > < br / > not to say that the film isn ' t an interesting concept , it ' s just told so oddly , ( bad screenplay ? ) especially when we " meet the family " for the first time . i know we ' re supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord , they could ' ve shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes ( seemingly , i didn ' t actually time it ) . by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit . 
NEG originally aired as an abc movie of the week . this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town . they aren ' t allowed phone calls and nobody knows they ' re there . what follows is rape , torture , beatings , humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion . < br / > < br / > the tv version was ( for its time ) grim . no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down . the unrated version is even worse - - there ' s plentiful nudity , the violence is extreme and , in one particularly disgusting sequence , we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard " uses " her . yuck ! there ' s nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink . you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded - - all this is shoved in your face like you ' re supposed to enjoy it . the needlessly downbeat ending doesn ' t help . < br / > < br / > i ' m giving it a 3 because the acting is good - - but that actually makes the movie harder to watch . a sick , sleazy film . not recommended . 
NEG after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover , i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good . nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features . . . but when i played the movie itself , what a let down . it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time . the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film . so don ' t believe it unless you like to waste your cash ! 
NEG i was aware of rohmer ' s admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts , and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures ( as renoir ' s or chaplin ' s very last movies ; yes , the " politique des auteurs " also has its dark side ) . but with " les amours d ' astrée et de céladon " , it ' s as if rohmer himself wanted , for what may be his last movie , to perpetuate this tradition of great directors , who made a last senile movie , by adapting urfé ' s " l ' astrée " , with ridiculous aesthetic codes , witch just look like a parody of rosselini ' s last movies ( the ones he made for tv from descartes or marx ' s lives ) . < br / > < br / > in his version of " perceval " , rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re - transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things . the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved , and films actors , dressed like 1600 ' s peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes . but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees . it ' s not that the story itself is stupid , but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny ( and i ' m not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors , the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly , the ridiculous soft - erotic tone , the poor musical tentatives , or the strange fascination for trasvestisment ! ) . < br / > < br / > the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke , which mixes a soft - erotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions ( sic ! ) . at the beginning of the movie , rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity , and that ' s why he had to film " l ' astrée " in other parts of the country . however , i ' m sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting , if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions . this film may interest a few historians , but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmer ' s movie . 
NEG < br / > < br / > when i first started watching this movie last night on cinemax , i was shocked that it had been made . cruel intentions , in my opinion , was one of the best teen - oriented films made in years . this prequel had certain things incongruent with the original . ( sebastian ' s father married into wealth , then why does he have a rich aunt on long island ? ) < br / > < br / > then i found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie , but rather a television series , manchester prep . after hearing that , it made sense to me that it wasn ' t the same as the movie , just as buffy the vampire slayer is different in tv form . < br / > < br / > i think that roger kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had , after the series wasn ' t picked up by fox . it just seems like something that would happen too fast ( sebastian becoming the male version of katharyn ) and i just don ' t know where they would go with the next episode , since it wouldn ' t be leading to the 1999 film ( which the newer ending is directed right towards . ) < br / > < br / > one thing i didn ' t like was that it suggested sebastian and his father had married into the wealth , which isn ' t typically looked good upon in this area of new york , and sine katharyn ' s mother was just an adult version of her , it didn ' t seem like something a woman in her position would do , marry a man not of her social class . < br / > < br / > as a prequel this is fairly lame . but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series . 
NEG this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did ( i think that laurel goes to " the prisoner of zenda " ) but it is surely the most depressing . sellers , especially sans makeup as nayland smith , looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy . as fu manchu , he looks hardly better and spends most of the film ( with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents ) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup . the supporting players also look tired and run down , and sid caeser ' s presence is offensive even without his constant references to " chinks ! " ( one bright spot : this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray asians so insultingly . . . or , for that matter , star a non - asian as one ! ) . the film seems surprisingly cheap , with soupy photography and drab sets - even the whiz - bang elvis number at the end looks cut - rate . only the stunning helen mirren and the tall , thin , nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair . all in all , this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic ' s death , and an even eerier documentation of his dying . 
NEG ben & arthur could have been a 10 . sam mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie . sam should have given his idea to a good writer , director , and left the acting to somebody who could act . this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production . there was nobody to tell him , " sam this is bad , really bad " . < br / > < br / > jamie brett gabel ' s acting was the only good point , but he could have been so much better with a good director , and better actors to work with . < br / > < br / > this movie is so bad i think sam mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie ( twice ) . the acting and direction was so bad , this movie was turned into a comedy . you just had to laugh , and in the wrong places . < br / > < br / > a second good point . . . . this would make a great date movie . after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date ! 
NEG oh my god . i bought this movie and . . . i . . . watched . . . the . . . whole . . . thing . . . okay , it ' s going to be alright . . . i ' l know i ' ll be okay in a month or two . some time soon i hope to be rid of the flash backs . i was going to eat something after the movie but i just can ' t seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment . bad ? yes bad . very bad . bad bad bad bad bad . wait , bad doesn ' t seem to get the message across in quite the right way . hmm . . . there isn ' t a word to describe just how awful . . . . not awful . . . hmm disgustingly horribly casted / acted / filmed / directed / written . now i don ' t know what to do but throw it out . possibly burn it i wouldn ' t want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now . the worst movie ever since " hey happy " 
NEG if an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts , and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts , it won ' t be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex . the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist . < br / > < br / > others have given this thing the dishing it deserves . for me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from la was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be lax ; and the return was signified by a shot of a fedex cargo plane . 
NEG randolph scott is leaving the usa for the greener pastures of canada ' s british columbia . he wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner bill williams and cook lee tung foo . they stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by victor jory . later jory rustles their cattle and williams loses his left arm during the fracas . < br / > < br / > from 1945 until 1962 when he retired , randolph scott made a series of good adult themed westerns , some of them considered real classics . unfortunately the cariboo trail will never be listed among his best westerns . < br / > < br / > it ' s more like the material that roy rogers or gene autry might use . the story is downright silly at times . williams who was along for the ride with scott , he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time . he doesn ' t blame the rustlers , he blames scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm . < br / > < br / > also there ' s a scene in the film when scott , lee tung foo , and gabby hayes are captured by indians . they escape because gabby ' s mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the indians allowing our heroes to escape . i ' m not sure that would have played in a rogers film . < br / > < br / > furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector randolph scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector gabby hayes on how to find gold . < br / > < br / > this was gabby hayes ' s farewell feature film part . it would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with randolph scott before this . < br / > < br / > i will say this , though no caribou made any appearance in the film , this is one of the few canadian locale films from the past that did not have any mounties . < br / > < br / > but if i were you unless you are a big fan of randolph scott or gabby hayes , take the next detour off the cariboo trail . 
NEG this is about the worst movie i have ever seen . this movie does match the quality of such movies as " they " & " cabin fever " , but even those had name actors where this one fell short . the " eye candy " of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift . ( just an example of the quality ) . i would have rated this movie in the negative if possible . ladies i have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at , but not much either . if you were planning on going to see this movie i would strongly recommend saving your money . 
NEG wow ! i didn ' t know that someone would make this movie ! its awful ! i have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie . < br / > < br / > number 1 : " its the biggest rave ever " where is the that rave ? i could only see a few people dancing around . . < br / > < br / > 2 . when they are on the rave , they can only see blood everywhere , no people , two ruined tents and one stage . . and what do they do ! ? they drink ! < br / > < br / > 3 . the worst actors i have ever seen ! the captain and his crew . . awful ! < br / > < br / > 4 . when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun , he shoots almost 30 times without reloading ! < br / > < br / > 5 . i didn ' t knew every person in the world could fight as a pro ! must be a new thing . . < br / > < br / > i wonder what the producer was thinking ! " this is going to be a big hit , its gonna be a classic " . . sure u dumb s * * t anyway don ' t see this movie , its a waist of time . my eyes are still bleeding ! 
NEG this film sold for one - dollar at wal - mart on a dvd and so i do not feel like i lost anything for watching this film , except my time . enjoyed the acting of tom hanks , ( robbie wheeling ) , who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script . the story is about college students who decided to play the game mazes & monsters , only in a very realistic setting . robbie wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades . robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game , he stops making love to her and acts like a monk . there are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former world trade center and also in the observation floor and roof area . it is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world . this is not a very good film , except for tom hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment . 
NEG after the already disappointing " final conflict " , the series hits rock - bottom with this very weak fourth entry . at least the third film tried ( unsuccessfully ) to continue the story of damien , while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the " omen " ( animals are afraid of the antichrist , the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film ) . but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here . and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid . 
NEG omen iv : the awakening starts at the ' st . frances orphanage ' where husband & wife karen ( faye grant ) & gene york ( michael woods ) are given a baby girl by sister yvonne ( megan leitch ) who they have adopted , they name her delia . at first things go well but as the years pass & delia ( asia vieria ) grows up karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her , karen is convinced that she is evil itself . karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who delia ' s real father was . . . < br / > < br / > originally to be directed by dominique othenin - girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by jorge montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone ' s guess as omen iv : the awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors . the script by brian taggert is hilariously bad , i ' m not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that i find even that hard to believe . as a serious film omen iv : the awakening falls flat on it ' s face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof , i mean the scene towards the end when the detective comes face - to - face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous gothic song has to be seen to be believed & i thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure . then there ' s the pointless difference between this & the other omen films in that this time it ' s a young girl , the question i ask here is why ? seriously , why ? there ' s no reason at all & isn ' t used to any effect at all anyway . then of course there ' s the stupid twist at the end which claims delia has been keeping her brother ' s embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of satan worshippers it has been implanted in karen so she can give birth to the antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft . at first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later . < br / > < br / > it ' s obviously impossible to know how much of omen iv : the awakening was directed by girard & montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it ' s a shabby , cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made - for - tv & it shows with the bland , flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design . then there ' s the total lack of scares , atmosphere , tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous omen films so effective . < br / > < br / > the budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was . the best most stylish thing about omen iv : the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path ' s but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything . i have to mention the music which sounds awful , more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding . the acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys . < br / > < br / > omen iv : the awakening is rubbish , it ' s a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid . the change of director ' s probably didn ' t help either , that ' s still not a excuse though . the last omen film to date following the original the omen ( 1976 ) , damien : omen ii ( 1978 ) & the final conflict ( 1981 ) all of which are far superior to this . 
NEG i recently decided to revisit the omen trilogy only to discover that { insert demonic music here } there is a fourth . i didn ' t expect much from it , and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations . if you ' re into watching bad movies for a laugh , then this just may be the movie for you . oh , where do we start ? < br / > < br / > from the onset , the " made for tv " look and feel of the movie was obvious . the music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore ( at best ) distracting . the script had all the suspense of an 8 year - olds work of fiction . but one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting . numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness . < br / > < br / > the story itself is quite thin , centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of damien thorn , adopted out by wrong - doing and badly acted nuns . there is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the " drama " unfolded , and the usual third - party investigator into the whole affair . later , via some medical phenomena , damien thorn jnr is born . and that pretty much wraps up the plot . the whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and / or ridiculous scene after another . < br / > < br / > there were many wtf ? ! ? moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief . for example , what ' s with the major over - reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother ' s cheek ? ? hardly a 360 - degree - head - turning omen . i also laughed at the over - reaction at the baptism . the baby cries , and everyone looks very concerned . the distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself . huh ? then there is the new - age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year - old to all kind of alternative spiritualism . i laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny ' s hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it . " yeah that ' s groovy , fill my troubled 8 year old daughter ' s head with all this mysticism stuff . that ' s cool . i don ' t need to be there . " of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack . the entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way , from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to delia , to the ensuing inferno . < br / > < br / > i also laughed at how the nun ' s death is considered a " freak accident " . here we have a religious zealot , ( who is described as being part of a cult ) , who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how god ' s glory will protect them . she antagonizes the snakes by handling them and somehow she is bitten several times . hardly a freak accident . more like a successful suicide attempt . < br / > < br / > the snakes - vs - nun scene wasn ' t the only comical death . there is the slow - speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot . then there is the slow - motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective . i believe i may have gone and made a coffee when the slow - motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the " concerned " detective . then there is the quintessential who - shot - who cliché death , where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances . then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was . additionally , the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me . he runs around looking at the architecture of the church . obviously finding this quite distressing , he eventually collapses , clutching his chest and dies . apparently something demonic was happening , as this is what the music was suggesting . ummm . ok . < br / > < br / > i am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and , in particularly , as a " worthy sequel " . it is difficult not to notice the non - sensical script , the unrealistic acting , and the inappropriate musical score . the movie lacks any suspense , relying heavily on delia ' s " demonic stare " to provide a sense of horror , which becomes rather annoying after a short time . < br / > < br / > bottom line : this is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it ' s unintended potential for being a comedy . 
NEG this is a truly wretched little film . admittedly the original ( un ) holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third , " the final conflict " degenerating into a ridiculous sub - plot about half - way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d ' etre for the " omen " series . but then to foist this jumped - up tv movie ( beware purchasers of the omen box set on dvd - don ' t be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer , this was and is strictly small - screen stuff ) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable , particularly , endorsed as it was , by the exec . producer and producer of the first three movies mace neufeld and harvey bernhard . i ' d give - away the plot if there was any , besides the usual death scenes ( hopelessly toned down for tv sensibilities ) and some of the worst acting i ' ve seen . all involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen , let alone masquerading under the omen name . if one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess , i ' ll feel better for it . 
NEG i saw the omen when i was 11 on tv . i enjoyed the trilogy . so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up . i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for tv film . however being a fan i couldnt resist . but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter . risible dialogue such as " it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god " . what nonsense . no decent set pieces . faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell . no suprises and no fun . however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was . truly pathetic . 1 out of 10 
NEG first of all , i too was expecting another hero - - a fantastic work of art for the action genre . i ' ve only seen parts of crouching tiger hidden dragon , but i can imagine that it is better than hofd . < br / > < br / > basic elements from hero are found in hofd : great landscapes , mesmerizing cinematography , and sincere acting ( i mean , if you can ' t understand a word they are saying , without the subtitles , but you still care - - that ' s good acting ) < br / > < br / > what went wrong ? what begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story . worse , it ' s a soap opera - like love triangle . you have three characters who , i guess , fall in love with each other - for no good reasons . this movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail ( i fell asleep about forty minutes into it ) . it ' s almost as if they changed writers at that point . the remainder of the movie is about how a character is " like the wind . " ick . also , you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces . this isn ' t unique to this genre , but since the story is weak , you can ' t wait for the action , and then , when the fighting does breaks out , it really wasn ' t that good . the beginning grabs you , but then this movie just runs out of gas . 
NEG i was very surprised how bad this movie was . nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far . i was hoping for a rerun of hero , but this is much , much worse . < br / > < br / > this movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place . no believable characters ( even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies , these characters are ridiculous ) , virtually no plot , and ridiculous story twists . < br / > < br / > this movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child . every time you think your silly battle makes some sense , they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ( " ah ha , you only think you ' ve got me with your super powers and 10 , 000 ray guns , but i ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon , so your ray guns don ' t work and i ' m invulnerable to your super powers . . . . tap tap no trade backs infinity plus one . " ) children can continue with this lunacy , because they don ' t really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time . however , for the viewer , especially the adult viewer , this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas . < br / > < br / > spoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers , ( a ) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on pcp , in which case your kung fu is not strong , ( b ) if you repeatedly fall on your back , which has a knife in it , it will hurt more and do more damage , unless it is a fake prop , ( c ) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife , you die , especially in ancient china where there isn ' t a kaiser permanente around the corner , ( d ) kung fu fights don ' t last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls , and ( e ) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations . < br / > < br / > in any event , go watch hero again , because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible . 
NEG while i watched this movie , i tried to figure out why they bothered making it . though the main plot of the movie is potentially good , there are all sorts of unrelated / unnecessary subplots . the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys , perpetual double - crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex . it ' s odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress . the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - i really didn ' t feel like i knew any character , except that everyone is corrupt and evil . the ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been , but what was supposed to be . in the end , there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do , except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double - cross . i ' m surprised that so many established ( and good ) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie . this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project . < br / > < br / > don ' t waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie . 
NEG spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made . probably in the style of ed wood ( without the heart ) . the lightning is terrible . the music is very bad ( piano and orgue . . . come on ! ) . the acting is . . . well there is no acting ! < br / > < br / > there ' s a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger . < br / > < br / > the killer is a fat , unscary clown who couldn ' t outrun a turtle ! < br / > < br / > every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort . < br / > < br / > the end is so far the most stupid ever made . think about it : the guy ( ken hebert ) who ' s acting skill is about the same as his writing ( he ' s the brain behind this flop ) invite a co - worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week - end and kills them . . . on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen . < br / > < br / > the tragedy is that mr . hebert try to make us beleive that it ' s a family affair that goes on for generation ( his uncle is the clown killer ) < br / > < br / > so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co - worker goes missing . . . < br / > < br / > whatever . < br / > < br / > 
NEG a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town , and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo , both zombie related . but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too . . . < br / > < br / > the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen . in fact i must confess , so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage . and there was a lot of that , believe me . it runs for just 69 minutes , and there is still tons of filler . you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups , plenty of dull kissy - kissy scenes between goofy teens ( that rhymed , tee hee ) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors . < br / > < br / > as for the title characters , they barely even have a footnote in the film . why , you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature ! though , considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are ( amongst other ' delights ' ) , maybe that ' s a blessing in disguise . < br / > < br / > and to top it all off , it looks likes it ' s been filmed on someone ' s mobile phone for broadcast on youtube . jerky camera - work , scratches on the print , flickering lights . . . i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 , and not 1971 . even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date ! < br / > < br / > if you think i ' m not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film , then go ahead . you try sitting through it , i betcha you won ' t even make it to the first appearance of the blue - smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving . it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it , and honestly you ' ll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror . in fact , don ' t for surprised if it packs it ' s bags and leaves in the morning , leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life . you have been warned . . . 0 / 10 < br / > < br / > p . s what kind of 18 - rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene ? ! see , the movie can ' t even get that part right . . . 
NEG one of the worst movies i ever saw . my only thought was : " how can i get my money back from hollywood video " . this is no way worth four dollars , or any dollars . i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican , or vin diesel ' s movies , but it failed miserably to do this . < br / > < br / > the acting was terrible , i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn ' t find something better to do with their time . the story was ridiculous . we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors , it was so predictable . the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated , worse than a cartoon . < br / > < br / > skip it . 
NEG it ' s about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions . at times it is clear how most of the ' doctors ' are charlatans , even lying about how they don ' t charge their clients . while they are wearing their gold watches , the ' donation ' box is mandatory . notice that there are only a couple of people who get ' cured ' while we see quite a few cases . < br / > < br / > keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee , while the average salary in india is 1 , 700 ru / month . 
NEG this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 . it looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier , and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture . i weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this . 
NEG because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story , without having to listen to banal dialogue , and be finished in 10 minutes max . come to think of it , even 10 minutes is too much to waste on enid - blyton - meets - struggling - wanna - be - artists . vomit . 
NEG in the many films i have seen warren oates , i have come to a definite conclusion , here is one talented individual . i first saw mr . oates back in the 1960 ' s television series called stoney burke . from then on , i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles . that happened in 1974 , when sam peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called ' bring me the head of alfredo garcia . ' of course , his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in ' the wild bunch ' . i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic , that is until i saw him in this flop . the movie is called " chandler " , a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950 ' s created by raymond chandler . because , the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye , i was immediately interested . however , i sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull , dis - interesting , slow pace , twisted , confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self . collectively and with some of hollywood ' s best supporting stars , such as alex dreier , mitch ryan , gordon pinsent , charles mcgraw , richard loo and scatman crothers , this movie had enough power to reach mach five , however , it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where . as a result , one of my favorite actor ' s got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground . * * 
NEG according to imdb , as well as to every other website that holds a review ; this " thing " doesn ' t have a director . well , that would surely explain a lot ! just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra - thin storyline about devil - worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium . " hardgore " is a prime example of totally demented 70 ' s smut , as it ' s really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration . horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70 ' s and pornography as well , so why not combine the two ? here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who ' s committed to a mental asylum , and from the first night already , she ' s drawn into a network of drugs , psychedelic orgies , rape , torture and dildo - action . really , a lot of dildo - action . the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her , but she has her throat slit even the same night . the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated , going from laughably un - scary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks . the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish , but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm - firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs ? leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body , but most of her co - stars ( male & female ) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls . 
NEG my kids picked this out at the video store . . . it ' s great to hear liza as dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom . but there are too many bad songs , and the animation is pretty crude compared to other cartoons of that time . 
NEG this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy , accept for it being an australian film with people who can ' t act . < br / > < br / > once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon . now , a number of years later , the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video . it is cliche - ridden and a waste of time and money , see it only out of curiosity , or if you ' re an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to ( not be able to ) act . lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours , but ended up in the x files - how did that happen ? 
NEG saw this late one night on cable . at the time i didn ' t know that the girl billed as " shannon wilsey " was actually porn star savannah , but she was so beautiful ( and got naked so often , thank god ) that i actually sat through this brain - rotting drivel . i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy - - more than the next guy , actually - - but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid . the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director ' s , writers ' and special effects people ' s virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie ' s only saving grace . savannah , before she turned into the plasticized barbie doll she became as a porn queen , is really interesting to watch - - she ' s drop - dead gorgeous , bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times , glances off - camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time , which is more than can be said for the audience . for even though savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked , it still can ' t hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid , badly made and annoying movie . if you know someone who has it on video , or if it comes on cable some night , check it out , but don ' t waste your money on a rental . 
NEG there ' s only one thing i ' m going to say about cat in the hat . . . as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks . . . i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren ' t exactly kid appropriate . oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying . . . as for the plot i completely forgot . who cares it sucked anyway . i ' m not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded - but so what it was annoying . don ' t see it - it belongs in the bottom 100 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the jokes are so unkiddy it ' s funny 
NEG no redeeming features , this film is rubbish . its jokes don ' t begin to be funny . the humour for children is pathetic , and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package . sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next . i couldn ' t enjoy the film at all . although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd , neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again , unlike with monsters inc , finding nemo , jungle book , lion king , etc . which all get frequent requests for replays . 
NEG i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production . but it turned out to be the the biggest let down . a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss . it was vulgar and distasteful i don ' t think dr seuss would have approved . how the grinch stole christmas was much better . i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on . whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked . growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen . lets see what they do with horton hears a who . i hope this one does dr seuss some justice . 
NEG the sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so i went to the movies , that cold , cold , wet date day . < br / > < br / > " the cat in the hat " was the name of the flick , and when it was over , my stomach was sick . < br / > < br / > mike myers played the cat , his humor was lame , and kids needn ' t see this , the humor was not tame . < br / > < br / > the film was like drinking milk , from a rabid cow , so it is fun to have fun , yet the filmmakers didn ' t know how . < br / > < br / > this film , in short is atrocious . the acting was bad , the plot was tweaked too much , and the humor was surprisingly very crude . < br / > < br / > it starts with conrad and sally , a rule breaker and a future sheriff . when their mother has to go to work , she gets mrs . kwan to babysit . possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs . kwan is watching a taiwanese court room , a ` la c - span . she soon falls asleep , and here comes the cat . < br / > < br / > the film starts to spiral out of control . the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun . he ' s got thing 1 and thing 2 , who suddenly start trashing the house . he improvises a tv infomercial , and accidentally slices his tail off . and when the cat goes full carmen miranda , it ' s not funny . possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist . and there ' s a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat . < br / > < br / > too bad he didn ' t warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk , or chopping your tail off . < br / > < br / > soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog , who has the key to a crate on his collar . if the crate is not locked soon , their house will be home to the cat ' s universe . here it gets a little more interesting , but not enough to save the film . < br / > < br / > the acting , overall , is horrible . mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat , saying things like " you dirty ho " and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata . spencer breslin is great as the trouble - making conrad , and dakota fanning is cute as sally , though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter ( accident waiting to happen ) . alec baldwin ' s slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting , ever trying to woo the kids mom , who is played by kelly preston . and sean hayes is mr . humberfloob , mom ' s boss , and is also the voice of the fish . the latter three are also bland . < br / > < br / > overall , if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor , cause there ' s plenty of it and more . save your $ 7 . 00 and see something else . as the late great dr . seuss once said , < br / > < br / > it is fun to have fun , but you have to know how . really , universal , stop ! theodore ' s already turning over in his grave . < br / > < br / > like my mom always says , " curiousity killed the cat " . - the cat in the hat * out of * * * * * 
NEG the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film . mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse . this is his worst film he has ever been in . the acting and the story was just terrible . i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr . seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all - time and such a disappointment . i couldn ' t have seen a more worst film than this besides , maybe baby geniuses . but this film is just so bad i can ' t even describe how badly they made this film . bo welch should be fired or the writer should . < br / > < br / > hedeen ' s outlook : 0 / 10 no stars f 
NEG this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being . the cinematography is good , the acting seemed solid , the dialogue wasn ' t too stiff . . . but then about twenty minutes in there ' s this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and it just goes south from there . < br / > < br / > on top of that , the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla - looking thing in curse of the demon . there ' s also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logan ' s run . < br / > < br / > in the end , the cinematography couldn ' t save this movie . despite some pretty solid performances by the actors , the story just doesn ' t go anywhere . i think " hellbored " would have been a better title for this . 
NEG i was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover . alas . it is easily one of the worst movies ever made . judging by the acting of the film characters , it ' s more a comedy than a horror film . no surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb . avoid it . 
NEG also known in a different form as " house of exorcism , " this messy < br / > < br / > little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value < br / > < br / > whatsoever . < br / > < br / > the spare plot involves european tourist elke sommer who has a < br / > < br / > chance run in with telly savalas , who looks just like the devil she < br / > < br / > saw on a fresco in the square . sommer is given a ride to a < br / > < br / > mysterious house in the country , where savalas happens to be < br / > < br / > butler . there , she is mistaken for a long dead woman , and the real < br / > < br / > soap opera theatrics begin . the house ' s blind matriarch ' s < br / > < br / > husband had an affair with the dead woman , who was the < br / > < br / > matriarch ' s son ' s fiancee . the couple who gave sommer the ride ? < br / > < br / > well , the woman is giving the chauffeur , uh , " back seat driving < br / > < br / > lessons , " and the husband knows and does not care . eventually , < br / > < br / > most of the cast is killed , sommer is drugged and raped , < br / > < br / > escapes , and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty < br / > < br / > airplane . . . which must have resembled the empty theaters this < br / > < br / > thing played in . < br / > < br / > the alternate version of this , " house of exorcism , " has scenes < br / > < br / > added involving a priest . < br / > < br / > the vhs copy of this , from elite entertainment , is crystal clear and < br / > < br / > letterboxed . there are " extras " after the end credits ; deleted sex < br / > < br / > and gore scenes . < br / > < br / > mario bava ' s direction is fast and furious , but his screenplay is < br / > < br / > awful . there are half baked ideas , abandoned plotlines , and < br / > < br / > stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing < br / > < br / > in some sort of forward direction . you have life like dummies for < br / > < br / > practice funerals , the blind matriarch does not act all that blind , < br / > < br / > and savalas is given the same lollipops he had in " kojak , " ( who < br / > < br / > haunts ya , baby ? ) . < br / > < br / > the project seems like they had two name stars , then wrote the < br / > < br / > script quickly , something that happens in hollywood on a daily < br / > < br / > occurrence now . savalas looks completely lost , delivering his < br / > < br / > lines haltingly , and wishing his character had not died in " the dirty < br / > < br / > dozen . " sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot , but < br / > < br / > her character is a blank , i use the term " character " loosely . the < br / > < br / > only thing we know about her is her name . < br / > < br / > this is a real weird film , and your reaction to it might depend on < br / > < br / > how heavily you are into eurohorror , and kojak . i for one cannot < br / > < br / > recomment " lisa and the devil . " < br / > < br / > this is unrated , and including all the extras at the end of the vhs < br / > < br / > copy , contains strong physical violence , sexual violence , strong < br / > < br / > gore , strong female nudity , male nudity , sexual content , and adult < br / > < br / > situations 
NEG sugar & spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 . the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails . when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie . i ' ve heard that the dvd has a director ' s cut maybe i ' ll check it out , but this pg - 13 trash movie is s * * * and the worst kind of s * * * . maybe if the film had some t & a that would ' ve have made it okay . but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible . worse than a troma film . 
NEG happy go lovely is a waste of everybody ' s time and talent including the audience . the lightness of the old - hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable . very few people watched these movies for their plots . but , they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots - - not here . they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs . not happy go lovely . and vera - ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it - - and instead she was called upon to carry the movie , and couldn ' t do it . the scottish locale was wasted . usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent . the photography was pedestrian . the musical numbers were pedestrian . cesar romero gives his usual professional performance , chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part , in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou . david niven is just fine , and no one could do david niven like david niven . at the end of the day , if you adore niven as i do , it ' s reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely . if not , skip it . 
NEG " happy go lovely " has only two things going for it . and those two things are vera - ellen ' s legs . this is a british ( excelsior films ) version of an m - g - m musical complete with second tier stars . i would imagine that vera - ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star . but , i ' m sorry to say , ms . ellen ' s chance did not pay off . < br / > < br / > opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune , this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy . the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin , and with the exception of david niven , cesar romero ( who is way over the top in his role of a producer ) and bobby howes ( who is totally wasted in a nothing role ) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable . < br / > < br / > the choreography is boring , but ms . ellen gives it her all . she was never as famous as most of the other musical stars ( and she shouldn ' t be since she couldn ' t sing and even had a " dancing stand in " in several of her pictures " . but when she did dance , it was just entrancing . < br / > < br / > it ' s too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine . < br / > < br / > 4 out of 10 
NEG let ' s face it - - if you rented a stdvd sequel of a forgotten 80 ' s gem , and expected it to be better than the aforementioned , then you are an idiot . wargames : the dead code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the dvd market has filled so easily . movies like this don ' t need spoilers , because you already know them . < br / > < br / > the " plot " for this " film " , is as follows : nerd meets girl ; girl likes nerd ; nerd likes girl ; nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer ; nerd and girl go to another country ; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government suits in the other country ; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the " film " ; nerd and girl are captured ; the top secret government computer gets crazy ; nerd is hired to beat top secret government computer ; nerd beats top secret computer by using the same old top secret computer from the first wargames " film " ; nerd saves the day ; nerd gets laid . < br / > < br / > the end . < br / > < br / > the acting , script , effects , score , and cinematography are what you would expect - - b - grade . some familiar faces are in here , and unless you are a mega fan of colm feore , then you should avoid this one . granted , the movie won ' t make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it , so if you like cheap looking stdvd sequels , then you are right at home . < br / > < br / > sadly , mathew broderick was too involved with some " masterpiece " , that he couldn ' t even do a five second cameo in this one . but can you blame him ? 
NEG i didn ' t enjoy this film . i thought the acting wasn ' t very good and the story was boring . a 20year old computer saving the day ? i thought that this was just slightly far fetched , even for a film . i couldn ' t figure out why they couldn ' t just turn it off , why not take a sledgehammer to it . < br / > < br / > its a shame , but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered . this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film , it wasn ' t . if that is what you want to watch , do not watch this film ! < br / > < br / > even if the old computer hadn ' t have turned up to save day , this would still , in my opinion , be a very very cheesy flick . . 
NEG former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison . i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz , but proximity isn ` t that kind of film , it ` s more like a " man on the run " film like the fugitive . it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases 
NEG very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story , but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice , gruesome make - up effects . daniella is a beautiful twenty - something girl , carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 . nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she ' s the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf . she kills her brother - in - law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital . she escapes again , however , and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives , doctors and relatives . it ' s all pretty to look at and listen too ( really great soundtrack ) , but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast . luckily enough , leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire . the film is too long , too weird and too forgettable . the biggest surprise comes at the end , when suddenly and out of the blue , director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts . yeah , right . . . 
NEG man , what the hell were the people who made this film on ? and more importantly where can i get some ? the opening scene sets the tone for the film : a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire , transforming into a werewolf . and this is no rick baker ' american werewolf ' transformation , folks . we ' re talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here . i can just imagine some stoned italian spreading glue on naked annik borel ( who plays daniela , the film ' s protagoness ( is that a word ? ) ) , and asking her to roll in fur . that ' s how bad it is . < br / > < br / > from here on in it doesn ' t get much better . minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about daniela and her condition or something ( i can ' t remember , but the dialogue is so bad if you don ' t laugh at it you ' ll cry ) . < br / > < br / > the funny thing is daniela isn ' t even a werewolf , she ' s a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around ( understandable , as she was raped as a child ) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor ( the opening scene ) . she can ' t help but tear out the throat of every man she meets , and she only wants to be loved ! things start looking up for daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn ' t trigger her ' episodes ' . check out the montage here , one of the cheesiest you ' ll ever see ( laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window ) . < br / > < br / > daniela ' s luck doesn ' t hold out as the film takes a brutal turn , she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman . reminiscent of " i spit on your grave " , daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists . < br / > < br / > this is 100 minutes of my life i will never get back . but hey , that ' s the game you play when you ' re a film geek . 
NEG right up until the end the bad guys have the upper - hand - always - which kind of put into question the competence of the good guys . a couple of innocent - man - accused - of - a - crime plots are irritating . some unnecessary dialogue in which various dull legal issues get debated . this is just a mediocre dumb old western , so what ' s this nonsense about trying to keep things " realistic " ? cagney ' s atypical presence in a western is one of the few - if not the only - entertaining thing about the movie . somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously - timed marriage proposal ; sort of like " where is the kid hiding ? ? ! ! where is he ? ! . . . oh , and by the way , will you marry me ? " 
NEG the movie is a total crap . we have two good actors who are miscast and a meat - head of an actor salman khan just to attract the female audience . the story is a crap . the characters poorly sketched . non existent story telling . no editing to speak of . ajay devgan as a rock star . . that is a dream in itself . the movie drags along to the point of decadence . the whole charade about arjun bringing his manna to london , let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at wembley ( vimbley in the dubbing process ) is absurd . salman khan ' s over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch . i remember seeing some good movies from this producer vipul shah but this is not one of them . it seems all the good directors are falling prey to the box office mania . . that the mumbai media morons have created . this is yet another crap movie in the lines of " wanted " with idiot actor like salman khan who has no place in a good hindi cinema . he is good to the indian cinema as titanic was to the winter cruise business . on a positive note - i like asin character dancing bharatnatyam when she changes to the western style dancing when the teacher is not looking . 
NEG this flick reminds me some really bad science - fiction movies from 50 ' s and 60 ' s . it is not scary or interesting , but it ' s dull , cheesy and stupid . special effects are laughable , all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful . don ' t waste your money , rent or buy something better . i give it 3 . 5 out of 10 ( i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity ) . 
NEG i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i don ' t believe there is a worse movie in the world . < br / > < br / > i hate this movie , i hate the acting , dialog , setting , writing and directing . i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell . < br / > < br / > damn this disgusting waste of time . < br / > < br / > i pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination . i pray that i dreamt the movie , and that i will never have to see it at < br / > < br / > my local video store again . < br / > < br / > burn in hell 
NEG otto preminger directs this light as a feather story . bohemian jean seberg and her equally bohemian widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty mylène demongeot . things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up . nivens , a degenerate womanizer , finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist . that ' s fine with seberg , as long as niven loves her and leaves her ( as he ' s done with all the women in his past . . . including demongeot ) . when it appears as though she ' s becoming second banana in niven ' s life , seberg exact revenge on kerr . preminger tells the story in flashbacks from seberg ' s perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes . the cinematography by georges périnal is stunning . the film features some of preminger ' s least heavy - handed direction , although he rarely allows any close - ups , which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling . arthur laurents wrote the script and it ' s full of acidic dialog and funny scenes ( mostly involving bird - brained demongeot ) . seberg acquits herself fairly well , but niven is at his least appealing . . . and he shows no chemistry with either seberg or kerr . preminger really mis - steps with that casting . it ' s a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer . with geoffrey horne as seberg ' s would - be suitor and martita hunt as his daffy mother . juliette gréco , playing herself , sings the title song in a paris nightclub . the great titles are by preminger regular saul bass . 
NEG a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed : one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods . this is simply not true . prior to the construction of interstate 64 , which bypasses the ocean view area , the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view . once the interstate was completed , ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime . this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park , which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg . meanwhile , in the past few years , the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought - after location for construction of high - end housing . < br / > < br / > it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film " rollercoaster " . this is also untrue . footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film , but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to " death of ocean view park " . < br / > < br / > as to the film itself , the storyline of a " supernatural " force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly , but somewhat typical for b - grade movies of the time . with the cast involved , there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors . i don ' t believe this film was intended to be another " citizen kane " ; i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non - nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into ( apparently not ! ) . a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table , but proved unmanageable in execution . the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway ; " let ' s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise ! " . < br / > < br / > for the casual movie viewer , this would be a " see once and forget about it " film ( except for diana canova fans ) ; but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park , this movie is like a " walk down memory lane " for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk , the first " harborfest " , and old dominion university . even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome . 
NEG it ' s pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the palestinian girl and her family . the film and it ' s website tries to imply that ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and rachel up - a boyfriend problem - perhaps pregnancy . neatly glossed over is the fact that ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the israelis ' - just outside her home . gosh , so why on earth would a young , pretty , intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing ? could it be that the hormonal , emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes ? this detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie . another neatly sidestepped detail is that avigail levy , rachels ' mother , could have prevented the destruction of the building the akhras family lived in ( along with 22 other families ) . one distinctly gets the impression that she ' s offering this as a " concession " - should mrs . akhras agree to speak with her . " why should i ? " she says . ( since the movie was made the home has been destroyed - apparently the interview didn ' t result in what she wanted - so bring on the bulldozers ) mrs levy claimed that she " wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope , a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds " - instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue ayats mother , while dangling the house as a carrot . moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart , she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her palestinian neighbors , that she really thinks that mrs . akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee ? please . and she forgoes the one chance she had to meet mrs . akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives . ( the akras family originally came from jaffa , but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the levys live in comparative luxury . any sympathy i would have had for the obviously well to do mrs . levy is dissolved by her air of self - righteous bitchiness . by contrast , ayats mother comes off as kind , forthright and loving - in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters . heck even the music and sound design was one sided - i guess the muezzin sings all day every day 4 miles from the levy family home , always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new - age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary . also there is the small matter of translations - mrs . levy directly addresses the camera in english when she has something worked out to say ahead of time , hebrew when she doesn ' t . mrs . akhras spoke only arabic which received sometimes a translation , sometimes transliteration , always awkward , and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie . they also " sweated " her under the lights , while mrs . levy sat in ( air conditioned ) comfort . rotten editing for mrs . akhras ' segments too . i gave it a 2 because i liked ayats mother and father , who seemed like good decent people . shame on hbo , producers and director , for releasing such a stink - bomb . 
NEG i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing , as i am , you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck . the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early ( and embarrassing ) footage . it ' s as if the producers of laugh - in sat down and decided to write a full length film , covering all the high points ( and more ) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment , then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $ 10 , 000 budget to complete it . hardly a classic , but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was , the silliness , the over - idealism , and the uptightness of the establishment . clearly not for everyone . 
NEG not that i dislike childrens movies , but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities . m . j . fox was the perfect voice for stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted . hugh laurie can be amazingly funny , but is not given the chance in this movie . it ´ s sugar - coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age . see toy story , monsters inc . or shrek instead . 3 / 10 
NEG this movie seems to send the wrong message . there can be morality without using christ . poeple of other religions , i believe , can get into heaven . i am a catholic who goes to church every week , but i do not agree with such christian arrogance . this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i ' ve seen timeline . 
NEG quirky , independent , theatrical , christian slater - - these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so " discovering " a jewel of a film . boy , was i disappointed . julian po never gets over itself . the film is relentlessly self - conscious . i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment . the overdone , obviously theatrical sets , the overdone , obviously theatrical acting , the overdone , obviously theatrical directing - - well , you get the idea . < br / > < br / > allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style . and it ' s hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him . the ridiculous girlfriend , the annoying townsfolk , the idiotic clergyman , the bratty kids - - why would anyone , particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside ( slater ' s character ) , decide to stay in such a dismal place ? 
NEG should have been titled ' balderdash ! ' little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved . little more than training film quality with poor camera work , muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping ' japs ' with laughing japanese infantry , laughing japanese fighter pilots and one - dimensional square - jawed americans dying left and right . sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you . the plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer ' s afternoon in my childhood , peering through the neighbor ' s hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend steve and my little brother . in actual fact , the makin island raid was a near total failure with carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally , thirsty and completely disoriented , looking for someone to surrender to , before they happened upon some equally confused japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them ! in the withdrawal several of carlson ' s marines ended up on another island and were abandoned ! the film , of course , couldn ' t tell that story , not in 1943 , so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums . with randolph scott , and his jaw , as colonel thorwald ( carlson ) leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures , the green recruit ( harry landon , robert mitchum ) , the grizzled veteran ( j . carroll naish , milburn stone , sam levene ) , the country - bumpkin ( rod cameron ) , the all - american boy ( alan curtis ) , and scores of sneering ( when they weren ' t laughing ) ' japs ' . and yet the cast nearly overcomes the material . almost . randolph scott ' s narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel . but in the end , the one - note object of the exercise wins . any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when randy scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring ( well sorta stirring ) call to arms . the cast was better than this material . so was the audience . should be viewed with reefer madness and a bottle of moderately priced merlot . 
NEG this movie was disgusting . their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage . what is garbage ? the misuse of peoples time , the misuse of energy , and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write . talia you are a sick demented loser . your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem . < br / > < br / > the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage . i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for . if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie . i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie " no more support from me . " how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho ? i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene . i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is ; congratulations you won his attention . 
NEG i mean really . this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind . okay , if you ' re a stoner and have nothing better to do , then maybe . i think film - makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have , and this is not the vehicle for it . come on now , this film is just tacky . 
NEG after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar . . . i found myself constantly switching through tv - channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait . < br / > < br / > this movie is listed as being in a number of genres , and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them . 80 % through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead . bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn ' t exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste . 
NEG johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts . minus the fangs , of course . they ' re dark , bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery . through their charms ( namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet , respectively ) they seduce desperate souls , who they proceed to torment and victimize . that ' s more or less the basis of this black comedy , as i understand it . < br / > < br / > it ' s not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to , partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy , main character . i did enjoy , however , the sound and the melody of the rapid - fire ( and supposedly very witty ) remarks . i was very impressed by the cast ' s strong acting , particularly david thelis ' s ; only the character of jeremy seemed too bi - dimensional . the photography and the music , both dramatic and somber , work very well together . < br / > < br / > what really turns me off about " naked " ( and the main reason i ' d never recommend it to anyone ) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one ' s angst . in other words , in a world that sucks so bad , what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls , right ? to suggest ( as some have on this website ) that johnny is not so unkind a person because he ' s not as rough on girls as jeremy , seems completely absurd to me . they ' re both terrible , nasty people . and they ' re particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance . one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves , as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass . but still , his and jeremy ' s sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter . and i could be wrong , but i ' m guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical . 
NEG people who actually liked problem child ( 1990 ) need to have their heads examined . who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny ? the movie is not funny , ever , in any way , beginning to end . it wants to be a cartoon , but the writers don ' t realize that slapstick isn ' t funny when people get attacked by bears , or hit with baseball bats . it may be funny in cartoons , but not in a motion picture . < br / > < br / > the film ' s young hero is junior ( michael oliver ) who , since he was a baby , has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption . the families reject him , because junior tends to give them a hard time . < br / > < br / > he is then thrown into an orphanage , where he terrorizes the nuns , and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bow - tie killer ( michael richards ) . he is soon adopted by ben and flo healy ( the late john ritter and his wife , amy yasbeck ) , who are dying to have a child , in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood . < br / > < br / > junior becomes a member of the healy household , and " little " ben takes an interest in him , despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site , or throws a cat at his father " big " ben ( jack warden ) , a bigoted politician . < br / > < br / > i think that we ' re supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people . his new mother , flo , is a bitch , his grandfather is completely selfish , and one little girl - - who despises adopted kids - - is such a spoiled brat . < br / > < br / > but what junior does to get the last laughs isn ' t funny - - it ' s mean , cruel , and sometimes life - threatening . < br / > < br / > and what is the film ' s message ? that kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism ? that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers ? they definitely don ' t what it ' s like to be a bad kid . junior isn ' t a one - - he ' s just a sadistic , little twerp . there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others . now , everybody ' s laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat . < br / > < br / > it ' s a shame that this movie has been marketed as a " family comedy . " what ' s worse is that problem child is rated pg . what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this ? there ' s a lot of profanity and mean - spirited pranks here , that one may wonder about the dividing between the pg and the pg - 13 . < br / > < br / > kids will enjoy this , but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen . and to most people , problem child will be considered a " guilty pleasure " classic ; a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking , even though the prevailing opinion , as put forth by more serious viewers , is that the movie is a piece of crap . 
NEG this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen ! i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time . completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . < br / > < br / > steer clear . 
NEG don ' t waste 90 minutes of your time on " fast food , fast women . " it ' s annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing , horrific acting , and even bad music . i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen . she needs the fast food . < br / > < br / > spend the 90 minutes you ' d devote to this turkey doing something more exciting . . . like trimming your toenails . you ' d have more entertainment value . < br / > < br / > the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser , but she deserves much better than this tired script . it ' s as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie . < br / > < br / > viewer beware ! 
NEG story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while . all the action is in the end , but you won ' t have to laugh because the movie is funny , but because the story is pathetic . < br / > < br / > the funniest part is when harvey ' i ' m not paranoia ' keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre . oscars for this guy ! 
NEG the next time you are at a party and someone asks , " the other day i heard the expression ' author ' s will ' . does anyone know what it means ? " tell them to sit through ' head above water ' . the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers . there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs . however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis . why does keitel tie diaz ' s hand in front of her instead of behind ? why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course . for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop . 
NEG yeti : curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan , unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas . unlucky really . with some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes . however just when they think their luck couldn ' t get any worse they soon discover that a huge , hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all . trapped , cold , starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time ? < br / > < br / > yeah , with a title like yeti : curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the sci - fi channel has made yet another ' creature feature ' although to give these things a bit of variety the sci - fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a ' beast feast ' ! as if that will make any difference . directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti : curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time , sure it ' s bad but it ' s sort of fun at times too . the basic premise is alright actually , it ' s a sort of cross between alive ( 1993 ) with it ' s plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer bigfoot ( another legendary hairy monster ) exploitation flick night of the demon ( 1980 ) which i would defend with my last breath & i have to say it ' s not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it ' s fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written . the character ' s are mostly annoying american teens , there ' s the expected arguing , there ' s the macho hero , the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there ' s no prizes for originality . there are some plot holes too , if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them ? how are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes ? why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end ? it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her ? the ' there are actually two yeti ' s running around ' twist isn ' t used to any effect at all either . at least there ' s a good pace about the film , it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & i never found myself becoming bored with it . there ' s some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not . < br / > < br / > the one thing you can always say about these sci - fi channel ' creature features ' or ' beast feasts ' is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again . the plane crash at the start looks awful & the yeti when it ' s cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it ' s on a pogo stick . there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm , a squashed head , a ripped out heart , some dead bodies , some blood splatter & the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped - off legs before biting a big chunk out of them . according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make - up which seems like a long time since it ' s actually a pretty tatty looking creation . apparently the original title was raksha : curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit , so now you know . < br / > < br / > this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci - fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh , bleak himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm . the acting isn ' t that good & i didn ' t think any of the girls looked that good either which didn ' t help . < br / > < br / > yeti : curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc - fi channel ' creature feature ' if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn ' t too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it ' s not very good . 
POS you know , robin williams , god bless him , is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade ( with perhaps the exception of " death to smoochy " , which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic ) . the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic , especially " insomnia " and " one hour photo " . " the night listener " , despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release , is among his best work , period . < br / > < br / > this is a very chilling story , even though it doesn ' t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . in high school , i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson , who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result . i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist . when i saw this movie , the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind . < br / > < br / > toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic " caretaker " . her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like " little miss sunshine " . there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me . it takes a good actress to play that sort of role , and it ' s this understated ( yet well reviewed ) role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award ( as of 2008 ) . it ' s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this , and it ' s scary too . < br / > < br / > this is a good , dark film that i highly recommend . be prepared to be unsettled , though , because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end . 
POS this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen . the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre . this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story . the casts is outstanding , including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before , ever . the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one . my one complaint , i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy , but other then that i think they did a great job . the dialog , the characters and the story was perfect . the acting was wonderful . this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci - fi channel . you heard me , the best movie to come out of the sci - fi channel . i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10 . 
POS just two comments . . . . seven years apart ? hardly evidence of the film ' s relentless pulling - power ! as has been mentioned , the low - budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal . having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se . < br / > < br / > true , the plot at its most basic is a re - working of the amityville horror - only without much horror . more a case of intrigue ! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax - investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the " house " as the main suspect . the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard . it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments . < br / > < br / > having picked the dvd up for a mere $ 3 . 95 last week at my regular video store , i cannot begrudge the expenditure . $ 10 . 95 would be an acceptable price for the film . just don ' t expect fireworks ! 
POS another aussie masterpiece , this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural , and it does very well . it doesn ' t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks , it focuses more on emotional impact . a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co . bring to life . it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside , and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago . strange things begin to happen in the house , and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared , who was actually a mass murderer . highly recommended . 8 / 10 
POS it ' s heart - warming to see a movie that doesn ' t bash males . in this one the wife / mother leaves her family to " get in touch " with herself - or pursue her libido . the father stays with and nurtures the kids , letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them . 
POS we watched this in my women ' s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies , and i absolutely loved this movie . i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch . the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone . i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed . this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating . this is a movie i will show to my children . the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women , but this movie was more than that . it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite . 
POS i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his / her reluctant guardian . i ' ve seen enough of them  baby boom , kolya , about a boy , mostly martha , and to some extent , whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula . what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting : small - town china in the 1930 ' s . extreme poverty was the norm , and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market . when wang discovers his purchased grandson , whom he ' s nicknamed " doggie , " is a granddaughter , he initially casts her out , even though she ' s showed great promise as street - performing heir . even after he reluctantly takes her back , he ' s not too upset when she ' s kidnapped . the film is gritty then , showing the lengths to which a young , street - smart girl had to go to survive in that society . < br / > < br / > the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context . in a western society , one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success . wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status , though , that i did , too . while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern , suburban child , it ' s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage . and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her , her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense . < br / > < br / > the peek at small - town life in a foreign country , the naturalness of the two lead actors , the surprising plot twists , and of course , the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film . 
POS a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon . although based upon the book by robert standish , this initial set - up is highly reminiscent of hitchock ' s " rebecca " , with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and ( almost immediately ) her own husband , who is still under the thumb of his deceased - but - dominant father . taylor , a last - minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh , looks creamy - smooth in her high fashion wardrobe , and her performance is quite strong ; however , once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her , one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic ( this feeling hampers the ending as well ) . still , the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs : romantic drama , a bit of travelogue , interpretive dance , an elephant stampede , and a perfectly - timed outbreak of cholera ! * * * from * * * * 
POS i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre . i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven ' t much changed . < br / > < br / > documentary about the infamous edward d . wood jr . covering his life and movies . there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him . they include : vampira , dolores fuller , bela lugosi jr . , loretta king , gregory walcott and paul marco . interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations . it is interesting ( somewhat ) but was this really needed ? i ' ve seen all of wood ' s films and they ' re just terrible . wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out . i wouldn ' t say he was the worst director ever but he ' s down there . do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker ? i do like the fact that they didn ' t try to make wood out to be some sort of saint . more than a few of those interviewed ( especially lugosi jr . ) pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear . also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s . still it ' s of interest if you ' re a wood fan . the best interviews are with vampira ( who tears wood apart ) and dolores fuller ( a long time girlfriend ) . 
POS i wait for each new episode , each re - run with anticipation ! the new look of sci - fi created by stargate sg - 1 is a wonder that i hope will never end . to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me . season # 9 should be a thrill in itself . i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season , as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o ' neill . the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner , season after season . you cancel this program in the next three years , and you make a serious mistake . also , you need a bigger role for the asgard - they are just too cool . 
POS i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b - rated movie . i came out surprised and very amused . eva was good , but lake bell stole the show . she had amazing comedic timing . the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between . the plot was enough to tie it all together , a woman ( eva ) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was - to - be husband , its sounds far - fetched but it actually works quite well . < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 - overall its a worthwhile cinema watch , if not get it on dvd when it comes out . 
POS actually my vote is a 7 . 5 . anyway , the movie was good , it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it , don ' t misunderstand me , is not the funniest movie of the world , and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies , but this one has its own taste , a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends . . . i think that not exactly but who cares ? also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic , chris rock appears in it , the name is down to earth , men , that one its a very funny movie , see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr . rock won with his movie . i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher , however , the film is good . 
POS i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it ! her inclusion as the silly ' vela ' has brought the series down in my estimation . to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake . < br / > < br / > unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of ' jack ' and really didn ' t need this great series turned into new episodes of ' farscape ' . < br / > < br / > i was a great fan of the film " stargate " and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film , but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked . i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation 
POS this isn ' t exactly a great film , but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . the film ' s main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene - - like he ' s some sort of omnipotent being but there ' s absolutely no explanation of him in the film ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy ) . < br / > < br / > the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou . this is capitalize on her success in amelie , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . the pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion isn ' t bad at all . the only reason i didn ' t score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots . 
POS the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific . according to this theory ( somehow related to the chaos theory , i ' m not sure exactly how ) , every action , no matter how small or insignificant , will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events . this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly - unrelated characters , most of them in paris , whose actions will affect each others ' lives . ( the six - degrees - of - separation theory can be applied as well . ) each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film . the acting is finely - tuned and nuanced ( audrey tautou is luminous ) , the stories mesh plausibly , the humor is just right , and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement . 
POS get ready for it : this is one of my favourite films of all time . i am relatively unaware of david mamet ' s ( writer and director ) other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times ( it ' s always a joy to watch ) , i can say without hesitation that he is a genius . this film is extremely well written , and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit , con - artistry and back room hustles . the feel of the film is very similar to the sting ( 1973 ) and it also pays homage to film noir . < br / > < br / > it ' s quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters . it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch . < br / > < br / > generally , the acting is superb - especially joe mantegna - but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it ' s not a good idea to have a heroine ( lindsay crouse ) who is not only a gambler , a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80 ' s hairdo . i agree , but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role . < br / > < br / > the less you know about the plot of this film , the better , just like mamet ' s most recent film , the spanish prisoner , because the ending will be even more impressive . just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance . 
POS ` bruce almighty ' will sweep the academy awards with a record 14 oscar wins ! it will surpass ` titanic ' as the highest grossing film of all time ! jim carrey ' s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 white house playoffs . almighty then ! these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers ( carrey included ) would possess the powers of god . that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey ' s new laugh riot ` bruce almighty ' . carrey plays bruce nolan , a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps . god , heavenly played by morgan freeman , grants bruce the ` gift of god ' ( his powers ) in order to challenge him if he can do god ' s job any better . obviously , bruce gets ` carreyed ' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly . carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in ` bruce almighty ' . jennifer aniston was not ` mis . pittiful ' as bruce ' s girlfriend . however , my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for # 2 , and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time ! ` bruce almighty ' is not the most in - depth carrey film , but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of ` carreyism ' ! * * * * good 
POS now either you like mr carrey ' s humour or you don ' t . me , myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and , on the other hand , cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream , but you have been warned . < br / > < br / > if you ' re not sure , watch the trailer . i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film . if you don ' t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny , don ' t bother with the movie . < br / > < br / > carrey , a reporter stuck in a rut covering ' lighter news ' berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better . carrey gets into the swing of having all of god ' s powers by making his girlfriend ( jennifer aniston ) ' s breasts bigger , getting himself promoted , and answering everyone ' s prayers by single stroke computer commands . < br / > < br / > this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable , but it is very well made within it ' s very limited intent , provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans , and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow - minded god - squadders and anti - god - squadders . < br / > < br / > on the more thoughtful level , the film tempts us to speculate about carrey ' s own career - stuck in his ' comedy ' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes . his most accomplished ' straight ' role , the man on the moon , is less well known that his comedy romps - or the truman show ( on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey ) . 
POS given the title , this first follow - up to quartet ( 1948 ) obviously reduces the number of w . somerset maugham stories which comprise the film . the author still turns up to introduce the episodes , but there ’ s no epilogue this time around ; by the way , while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r . c . sheriff , here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation , as well as noel langley ( though it ’ s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison ) . as can be expected , much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members , namely naunton wayne , wilfrid hyde - white and felix aylmer ( the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled “ the colonel ’ s lady ” ) . while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor ( slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running - time ) , it ’ s still done with the utmost care , acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain . < br / > < br / > “ the verger ” tells of a church sexton ( james hayter ) – for which the story ’ s title is another word – who ’ s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest ( michael hordern ) simply because he ’ s illiterate . rather than rest on his laurels , despite his age , he not only takes a wife ( his landlady , played by kathleen harrison ) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and , with business flourishing , this is developed into a whole chain . the last scene , then , sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who , not only is surprised to learn of hayter ’ s lack of education , but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy ( and respected ) tobacconist replies , with some measure of irony , that he had the calling to be a verger ! < br / > < br / > the second episode , “ mr . know - all ” , is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging : a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man ( nigel patrick ) , british despite his foreign - sounding name of kelada , who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun . naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde - white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick ’ s attentions to his pretty wife ( anne crawford ) . during a fancy - dress party , however , the passengers decide to enact their ‘ revenge ’ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him ( a jest which he naturally doesn ’ t appreciate ) ! ; still , it ’ s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by crawford that the necklace she ’ s wearing is an imitation , wayne challenges patrick to name its price … but the latter realizes immediately that it ’ s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford ’ s position if he were to tell , so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer ! < br / > < br / > as can also be deduced from the title , “ sanatorium ” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by andre ' morell ; the protagonist is a new intern , roland culver , who wistfully observes the various goings - on . the narrative , in fact , highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous ( the ‘ feud ’ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium , played by finlay currie and john laurie ) , one melodramatic ( the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long - suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies ) and one bittersweet ( the romance between naïve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which , in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a ‘ lifer ’ while rennie only has a few years left to him , leads the couple to the altar ) . 
POS this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham ' s short tales . the first one is the verger , which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable . after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can ' t read nor write . so what does he do ? opens a tobacco shop , of course ! < br / > < br / > the second is mr . know - all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten , until i heard the familiar introduction . another 15 minute one , and also very good . it worked better on film than in a book for me , but then perhaps that ' s because i was only 14 the last time , afterall . < br / > < br / > the 3rd one is nearly a let - down . almost an hour in length , it simply drags . it ' s not all that bad , but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 . i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour , and found that it still made sense and really i hadn ' t missed a thing ! < br / > < br / > overall i give them 8 , 9 , and 6 out of 10 , respectively . 
POS a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth . i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish : high anxiety , the cheap detective , the black bird , don ' t look now we ' re being shot at . . . . . . . . . . and have no profile at all today . norman was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it , laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again . famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film , an experiment at the time , norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today . if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either . it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong . just as it should be . in fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today . 
POS fascinating movie , based on a true story , about an australian woman , lindy chamberlain ( meryl streep ) accused of killing her baby daughter . she insists that a dingo took her baby , but the story is highly suspicious . the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case , the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media , and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman ' s conviction , based on barely any hard evidence . i love films that question the media , and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . i ' ve always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties . it ' s not , as has often been said , a liberal movie , but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . a cry in the dark is likewise clinical . schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . some may find the film boring or dry , but i found it engaging . 
POS this is an extremely - powerful based - on - a - true story film that can be infuriating to watch . i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people , in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby . < br / > < br / > meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good . let ' s just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent . ( she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts . ) < br / > < br / > without giving anything away , all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally . 
POS roll is a wonderful little film . toby malone plays an 18 year old kid ( very well acted , by the way ) who is into soccer . malone ' s cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags , a drug lord , some tough bikers , some cops , and some prostitutes . . . and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law , what the contents of either gym bag is , and even what gender a key biker is . parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels . < br / > < br / > for me , roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll . those opinions are : 1 . i really want to visit australia one day . the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation . < br / > < br / > 2 . some of the best filmmakers in the are australian . the cinematography in roll was especially impressive . i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes . < br / > < br / > 3 . australian women are hot ! 
POS plato ' s run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey . it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to . gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer ( scarface ) and action star jeff speaksman ( the expert ) . what i liked about plato ' s run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato ' s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato ' s run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10 
POS probably the finest fantasy film ever made . sumptuous colour , spectacular sets , incredible , spot - on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood . acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands , but here the poetic dialog is deftly , sensitively spoken ( the humour is subtle and delightful as well ) . < br / > < br / > doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one . along with " the four feathers " ( 1939 ) , one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films - - - and one of the finest motion pictures ever made . < br / > < br / > a true , compelling classic ! 
POS abu , the thief of bagdad , helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer . < br / > < br / > as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames , sir alexander korda ' s london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights . replete with swords & sorcery , it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines . it also is a fine piece of film making , featuring good acting and an intelligent script . < br / > < br / > conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it , playing the evil magician jaffar . his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days . here is a villain worth watching . as the boyish thief , sabu is perfectly cast in this , his third film . while not a hero in the typical sense of the word , his character is certainly heroic in deed & action . < br / > < br / > the rest of the cast do fine work . john justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way ; sabu gets a significant part of the action ( when he ' s not transformed into a dog ) but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must . lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra , coveted by two very different men . appearing late in the film , massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude . < br / > < br / > allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller . miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra , forever dithering on about his mechanical toys ( malleson was also responsible for the film ' s screen play & dialogue ) . aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend . mary morris , later an exceptional stage actress , plays the dual roles of jaffar ' s accomplice and the six - armed silver dancer . < br / > < br / > the film was begun in britain , but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california , which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast . the art direction , in vibrant technicolor , is most attractive , especially the fairy tale architecture in blues , whites & pinks . < br / > < br / > * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * < br / > < br / > born sabu dastagir in 1924 , sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore ' s stables when he was discovered by korda ' s company and set before the cameras . his first four films ( elephant boy - 1937 , the drum - 1938 , the thief of bagdad - 1940 , jungle book - 1942 ) were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed . after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career , but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films , black narcissus ( 1947 ) being the one great exception . his final movie , walt disney ' s a tiger walks ( 1964 ) was an improvement , but it was too late . sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 , only 39 years of age . 
POS but sadly due to rights issues , that almost certainly will never happen . transcripts of joe bob ' s commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet , but they don ' t quite capture his twang inflected delivery , which was a real hoot . nowadays , joe bob ( real name : john bloom ) is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as " i spit on your grave " ( featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time ) , and jason x , one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time ( the series was never the same once it left paramount ) . all i could think when they canceled it was : " damn , where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping , blonde jokes , and horror trivia every saturday night ? does this mean i have to get a life now ? " sadly , it does . but there ' ll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for " monstervision . " long live the drive - in ! 
POS i love this film . it ' s one of those i can watch again and again . it is acted well by a good cast that doesn ' t try too hard to be star studded . < br / > < br / > the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller . either would have killed the film completely . < br / > < br / > the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel - good factor throughout . < br / > < br / > it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes . . . ( no that ' s not a spoiler ! ) 
POS saving grace is a feel good movie with it ' s heart in the right place . grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts . she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana . she ' s living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors . there ' s only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it ' s user . it ' s obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff . the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny . it ' s precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick , and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable . 
POS after her oscar - nominated turn in " secrets & lies " , brenda blethyn starred in the equally great " saving grace " . and let me tell you , this is not the sort of movie that you find every day . < br / > < br / > after her husband commits suicide , grace trevethyn ( brenda blethyn ) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt . fortunately , she finds a way to make ends meet : marijuana . that ' s right , grace starts cultivating it . < br / > < br / > every aspect of this movie was played to great effect ; there isn ' t a dull moment anywhere in it . and i sure didn ' t see that end scene coming ! but anyway , you gotta see this movie . you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it . if nothing else , it might function as a good lesson about knowing one ' s finances . but of course , there ' s a lot more to it than that ! 
POS " emma woodhouse " gwyneth paltrow ( shakespeare in love , duets ) has nothing to do with herself but painting , going with her friends on her chariot up and down , saying hello to people in town , and trying to match make everybody she knows . i guess there were no movies , no television in those days , and the girls had nothing to do but gossip . i wish she had read a little more . i like gwyneth , and think that she is a lovely young woman . she is talented , and in " emma " one has the privilege to hear gwyneth sing . i am looking forward to seeing " duets " , where she is suppose to sing . she is brave to speak british english with all those native britons , including emma thompson ' s sister , " miss bates " sophie thompson ( four weddings and a funeral , dancing at lughnasa ) . " mrs . elton " juliet stevenson ( truly , madly deeply ) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991 . gwyneth is part of the american movie royalty , being none other than the daughter of director bruce paltrow ( st . elsewhere ) and tony award winner blythe danner ( the myth of fingerprints ) . she will hopefully be around for a real long time . lucky us ! i liked emma and also recommend it . it is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days . favorite scenes : emma singing and playing the piano . i specially like it when she sings a duet . favorite quotes : mr . knightley " : emma , you didn ' t ask me to contribute a riddle . " emma : " your entire personality is a riddle , mr . knightley . i thought you overqualified . " miss bates : " it left us speechless , quite speechless i tell you , and we have not stopped talking of it since . " 
POS a slight , charming little movie to be sure , but a superbly - crafted one . gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent , and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue . this came out around the time of sense and sensibility , and i ' m sure i don ' t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention . emma is jane austen ' s most accessible and least stuffy story , told well . 
POS the only word that sums up this movie is quirky . it ' s a light - hearted romp through an existential concept . bouncy ( in more way than one ) and a bit nutty . i wouldn ' t exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn ' t seem quite as memorable as the director ' s first movie " cube " but it ' s a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning . the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that ' s how it was to be written . done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension . a little like " the matrix " meets " head " meets " human nature " . < br / > < br / > 6 . 8 out of ten 
POS 089 : footlight parade ( 1933 ) - released 9 / 30 / 1933 , viewed 5 / 5 / 07 . < br / > < br / > the ice cream cone is invented in new york . < br / > < br / > kevin : after a long and busy break , we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros . this time it ' s the ultra - fast paced footlight parade , starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent . i am 100 % certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent , who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute . joan blondell is also excellent as the acid - tongued secretary - turned - love interest . the ruby keeler / dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable . one thing that baffled me was berkeley ' s performances themselves , which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage , let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards . obviously busby doesn ' t let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over - the - top musical numbers he can possibly conjure . i liked nearly all of this movie until the end , with the shamelessly offensive number " shanghai lil , " which , as one can guess , is about as stomach - turning as racially distasteful performances come . < br / > < br / > doug : six movies in three months . got to be a new record . anyway this completes warner bros . ' musical trilogy of 1933 , preceded by ' 42nd street ' and ' gold diggers of 1933 . ' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row . i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie , or if that the role as written was inspired by busby . i hope it was ; it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does . the funny thing about cagney was that he didn ' t really look like a leading man in the traditional sense . he was 5 ' 7 " , square - headed , and talked with an odd new york accent . but the guy was quite versatile , going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast - talking producer - types we see here . and he could dance . basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor . the rest of the cast has some familiar faces ; joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney ' s loyal and lusting secretary ; dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple , but seem to get less screen time than before ; billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp . the movie is typical of the more racy and adult - oriented musicals of the pre - code era , as opposed to those of the 50 ' s and 60 ' s that were more family oriented , and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year ( the " shanghai lil " number not withstanding , with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese ) . < br / > < br / > last film : dinner at eight ( 1933 ) . next film : i ' m no angel ( 1933 ) . 
POS wow . . . what . . . a whirlwind . the 30 ' s is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine , especially during the early talkies phase . there were movies which are painfully static and dull , like " dracula " with bella lugosi , and there were those that just don ' t give it a rest , sometimes in a good way and other times not . this is one of the films that don ' t stop for a minute , and that is both a wonder and a pity . lloyd bacon , who also directed " 42nd street " , must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema , for he filled this picture with it . there mustn ' t be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking . it ' s completely crazy ! i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 ( or a 6 , tops ) because the pacing was very poor , since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn ' t know what was happening and what to think . the characters seemed to just running to and fro places , talking about things which didn ' t interest me and probably no one else . i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache . i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in " 42nd street " , ruby keeler , and " 42nd street " was a movie whose ending was the best part of it . and you know what ? it happened the same thing with " footlight parade " ! the ending is absolutely incredible ! it has become , hands down , the most impressive musical i have ever seen . the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are , believe me , something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth . the numbers are flawless ! there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one . suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work , beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache . 
POS gotta start with ed furlong on this one . you gotta . god bless this kid . $ 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he ' s really like in real life . he has a one - liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script . you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn ' t even seem like furlong is even acting . maybe that ' s why his performance was good . same with madsen . you keep thinking , " i bet this guy is really like this in real life . " does madsen even have to act ? just natural . vosloo has obviously moved on from the type - casted mummy guy . i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro ' s performance . her reactions are spot - on in this film . i battled if she was hot or not , but realized i would just like to see more of her . < br / > < br / > not a big fan of shoot ' em out / hostage type films . but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing . it ' s not just your standard robbers take over a bank , they kill hostages , and the good guys win in the end type of film . the twists keep on coming . . . and coming . < br / > < br / > the café scenes work best with the hand - held cams to show what it ' s really like in there . not glossed over a bit . think like bourne ultimatum " lite " style on some scenes in the café . < br / > < br / > and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne ( who plays karl ) will make you do a double take . these guys are twins . < br / > < br / > as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town . made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries / states so they might have these accents . but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of . and some of them are smoking hot . moncia dean ? need i say more . 
POS my cable tv has what ' s called the arts channel , which is a " catch - as - catch - can " situation sometimes , sometimes films , sometimes short clips of films or ballets , and i came into this just as the bar scene came on , where they tear up their coupons . excellent , exquisite , ealing wins again , my wartime - glasgow - raised mother would love this , should i ever find a copy of it . some of britain ' s best artists , from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford , having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office . loved the last scene , where as soon as they are " back in england ! " the temperature plummets and it rains . . . 
POS all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing . the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis . the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do . the main actors and actresses i . e . jessica alba michael weatherly etc . make you forget you are watching a fictional t . v . show they seem to make this show come alive . all in all this is the best show i have ever watched 
POS the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show . the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable . the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old , but good acting and production make the movie worth watching . the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects . i rated it an 8 out of 10 . 
POS i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw . it was a cool fun movie . dolph looked superbly cool on the bike . he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies . he is now in a pretty good shape . the story was ok and the other actors were also passable . i wouldn ' t call this movie his best but its still a good movie . < br / > < br / > but it also had its share of problems . the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target . they should ' ve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way . another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing . i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom . the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers . there should ' ve been more bad guys . last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget . overall the movie was a good movie . i enjoyed it . i would recommend others to watch it . p . s . now u r a dead beat cop . ( some one - liners were also cool ) < br / > < br / > 
POS this is a great film ! ! the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now . i may not have seen the play , but even if i had it wouldn ' t stop me thinking that the film is just as good . 
POS one of the comedies of the 1970 ' s . also has the best signature tune of any comedy show . the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred . the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing . a man and two women . richard o ' sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox . its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success . < br / > < br / > the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard ' s frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm . the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970 ' s but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements . 
POS good , funny , straightforward story , excellent nicole kidman ( i almost always like the movies she ' s in ) . this was a good " vehicle " for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both . a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories , great closing lines . chaplin , very good here , was also good in another good , but unpopular romantic comedy ( " truth about cats & dogs " ) . maybe they ' re too implausible . ebert didn ' t even post a review for this . the great " screwball " comedies obviously were totally implausible ( " bringing up baby " , etc . ) . if you ' ve seen one implausible comedy , you ' ve seen them all ? or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s . weird . birthday girl is a movie i ' ve enjoyed several times . nicole kidman may be the " killer app " for home video . 
POS this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever ! < br / > < br / > i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish , but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit " like super cool " with a " like totally bitchin " belt and stick on rhinestones on her face . < br / > < br / > but anyways , the movie is actually one of the few " family " movies that holds your interest . i know that the begining drags , particuarly if you know what is going to happen , but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film . < br / > < br / > i wouldn ' t stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie , in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself , but i ' ll admit it here with the internet to hide behind . < br / > < br / > 
POS great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time . . that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item . . what shocked me was not only the attacks , but the " high fat diet " and physical appearance of some of these firefighters . i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that , in the physical shape they were in , some of these firefighters would not of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear . having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job . the french have a history of making great documentary ' s and that is what this is , a great documentary . . . . . 
POS the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world . the show was hilarious to say the least . simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages . running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game . the action was mesmerizing , and cleverly set up . the characters were very original , each with a very different personality . but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters . each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed , but implied in subtext . hopefully , one day , there ' ll be some way to watch the rovers in action again . 
POS there are a few spoilers in this comment ! ! < br / > < br / > contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others , i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series . < br / > < br / > i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i ' ll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little , the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired . < br / > < br / > the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed . i do fail to see how that many " professionals " weren ' t able to hit a moving target , but the action was definitely there and deke , being the hero , had to survive . < br / > < br / > as for the comment about needing to " get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs . " this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001 , a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u . s . < br / > < br / > if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it , maybe they would have realized the plot of the story : rashid , a bin laden like character , planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states . the president ' s man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem . < br / > < br / > perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it . < br / > < br / > 
POS this movie is far better than the original the jerk . i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor . we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python . < br / > < br / > the card game with the hobos and then with mr . suicide . the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup . the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged . while i like steve martin , he seemed like he was trying to hard . the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone . the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk . 
POS movie " comedies " nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor , foul language , and groin - kicking . modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator , the undemanding and slow of brain . sure , an occasional good comedy will come along , but they ' re becoming rarer all the time . < br / > < br / > " mr . blandings buildings his dream house " shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of , and it ' s just screamingly funny . jim and muriel blandings ( cary grant and myrna loy ) decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs . the film follows their story , beginning with house hunting trips , the house ' s riotous construction , all the way to the finished home - - with its " zuzz - zuzz water softener " . < br / > < br / > grant and loy are perfect for their roles , of course ( grant is particularly funny as he watches the house ' s costs zoom out of control ) . however , the film is stolen by the blandings ' wise attorney , played to perfection by melvyn douglas . managing to steal every scene he ' s in , douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis . reginald denny as the blandings ' harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful . < br / > < br / > i ' ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh . i think it ' s a good film to watch when you need a lift , whether you ' re building a house or not . 
POS well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen . the effects are so bad you just have to laugh , and the acting , well lets say its no mel gibson . but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad , he becomes good . i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10 . you must see it if your in to horror / slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time . killer movie . 
POS sure this movie wasn ' t like . 16 blocks , inside man , an american haunting . etc . . . < br / > < br / > but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us . . i found this movie really great and scary . < br / > < br / > i live exactly where they filmed this movie " san pedro , california " and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie . < br / > < br / > i dunno if you ' ve heard of the famous boat in long beach " queen mary " well that boat is haunted . i believe in spirts , illusions , and parallel or however u spell that . is real . everybody ' s in there own universe . < br / > < br / > and the mind is a powerful thing . < br / > < br / > i recommend to watch this movie . it ' s great , and not bad directing at all . < br / > < br / > for those who rate it a 1 . they don ' t understand the film . its meaning . its plot , its view . and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us . < br / > < br / > ty . < br / > < br / > victor 
POS i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm , happy feeling . i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time ! i thoroughly enjoyed this film . the acting was superb , although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance . bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films . timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance . and billy connolly , as always , totally gorgeous . it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned . such a refreshing experience to see a well - written , superbly acted and good - looking movie . 
POS another example of the unique talents of cary grant . a performance worthy of oscar consideration , yet once again shunned by the academy . mr . grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city . the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis ( loosely ) for the more modern tom hanks vehicle , " the money pit " . < br / > < br / > if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex , this movie is a must see . 
POS < br / > < br / > i must admit , i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of ' cut ' last night , though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem . i am a true horror fan as true as they come , and found ' cut ' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced , but one of the great parody / comedy films of late . < br / > < br / > my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it ' s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could . i am certain this was intended as humour . . . . hoping this was intended as humour . < br / > < br / > and of course , there was the gore . < br / > < br / > the use of the ' customised ' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes . in short , there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths , enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth . < br / > < br / > the appearance of both kylie minogue ( short that her appearance was ) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic , as well as simon bossell ( ' the castle ' ) in a brilliant role as the jokey technician . < br / > < br / > all in all , i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years , as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue - in - cheek till the very end . < br / > < br / > loved it . go see it ! 
POS what ' s not to like about this movie ? every year you know that you ' re going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible . this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well . a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him . what is the good of having money like that if you can ' t do fun things with it . it was a win - win situation . a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined . only if . < br / > < br / > drew latham ( ben affleck ) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands . it was a fun and funny movie . 
POS its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site . it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection . the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role . i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it . i rate it right up there with christmas vacation . the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well . the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act . the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks . plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can ' t buy love with money . 
POS this movie isn ' t as bad as i heard . it was enjoyable , funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season . it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music . when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection . it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year . i heard that ben ' s character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time . take it for what is it , a christmas comedy with a love twist . i enjoyed it . no , it isn ' t titanic and it won ' t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two . so go laugh and have a good time : ) 
POS little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for . even though their house was filthy , this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness . on the message board a poster wrote that " little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old . " this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version , big edie says to little edie , " if you ' re stuck , it ' s only with yourself ! " these women had everything ; beauty , talent , intelligence , firm belief in their opinions and actions . perhaps if little edie wasn ' t so hard on herself the first time things didn ' t work out , losing her hair , her job , and the love of her life , she would have made it . this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness : her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead . the world will never know what have happened if she didn ' t listen to her mom ' s plea , " come home , edie ! let me take care of you ! " < br / > < br / > yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant , heartbreaking , and lovable , even in their extremely filthy home . these women were extraordinary , and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness . when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns , dwelling about what could have been , or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl , one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that " everything will be okay ! " < br / > < br / > great documentary ! ! < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 
POS i first saw this movie in my plays & playwrights course at tulane . i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was . it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude . the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core . * * as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming , little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men . * * the beauty , i find , comes from the naturalness of the family ' s dysfunction . it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie ' s rehabilitation to society . in all , the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it ' s portrayal of surprising beauty . two thumbs way up ! 
POS i knew about but had never seen grey gardens , before i saw the broadway musical of the same name . friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie , the musical would not make sense . it did , but it also prompted me to rent the movie . at first , i thought it was a train wreck , full of strange , shrieking characters , and it was exceedingly hard to watch . but being able to stop it , digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary . < br / > < br / > both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self - consciousness is worth witnessing . both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age . they have a relationship that will chill any woman ( and undoubtedly some men ) and make you re - examine your own dealings with your mother . in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace , it ' s fascinating to see the mayleses ' work from three decades ago , and realize what an impact the film must have had . < br / > < br / > i echo what other posters have said : how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family ? but beyond that , how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion ? or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped ? i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track , which gave me additional insight into the film . 
POS i found grey garden ' s to be a gripping film , an amazingly intimate < br / > < br / > look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea : forget < br / > < br / > society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge < br / > < br / > brood of cats and raccoons , persuing their own interests rather < br / > < br / > mundainly , all the while chattering at the camera . < br / > < br / > big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros . < br / > < br / > have chosen to document . they seem like characters out of a < br / > < br / > fellini film , only stranger , if that makes any sense . old edie is < br / > < br / > almost fully bedridden , a pile of papers , clothes and dirty dishes < br / > < br / > growing around her . little edie is even more interesting . she < br / > < br / > prances around the house , always wearing a baboushka - like < br / > < br / > headdress around her head , completely covering her hair . we < br / > < br / > never see her hair throughout the film , nor do we ever get a hint < br / > < br / > that she still has much . at age fifty eight , though , she is still < br / > < br / > beautiful and full of life . < br / > < br / > in grey gardens , we get the sense that both of these women ' s < br / > < br / > lives have become much less than what they once were . little < br / > < br / > edie is probably the sadder of the two . while her mother , in her < br / > < br / > earlier years , got married , made a family , lived luxuriously and < br / > < br / > even made some recordings ( the scene where , at 77 , she sings < br / > < br / > along with a recording of " tea for two " she made decades ago is < br / > < br / > one of the films best scenes ) , edie left her promicing career as a < br / > < br / > model to take care of her ailing mother . at 58 , she still longed to < br / > < br / > find her prince charming . if anything little edie is still a little girl , < br / > < br / > full of dreams of glamour and fame , and of domestic and romantic < br / > < br / > bliss , that have yet to be fulfilled . < br / > < br / > highlights of the film include the opening moments , where little < br / > < br / > edie explains her outfit to the camera , the " tea for two " sequence , < br / > < br / > the birthday party , the climactic argument , the grocery deliver < br / > < br / > scene , and the scene in the attic . the whole thing is incredibly < br / > < br / > candid and unpretencious . and it ' s made all the more remarcable < br / > < br / > since it ' s all real . < br / > < br / > i suggest seeing grey gardens back - to - back with the kenneth < br / > < br / > anger short puce moment . the criterion dvd is $ 35 . 00 , but it ' s < br / > < br / > worth every penny . 
POS after the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber ( michelle joyner ) . eight months has passed . . . the rocky mountain rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind eric quaien ( john lithgow ) . quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside . two experienced climbers walker ( sylvester stallone ) and tucker ( micheal rooker ) and a helicopter pilot ( janine turner ) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by quaien and his men . now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek . while quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped tucker to find the money . once tucker finds the money , tucker will be dead . against explosive firepower , bitter cold and dizzying heights . walker must outwit quaien for survival . < br / > < br / > directed by renny harlin ( driven , mindhunters , a nightmare on elm street 4 : the dream master ) made an entertaining non - stop action picture . this film is a spectacular , exciting , visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well . this was one of the biggest hits of 1993 . this is one of harlin ' s best film . lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain . stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller . this is probably harlin ' s best work as a filmmaker . < br / > < br / > dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen ( 2 . 35 : 1 ) transfer and an terrific - dolby digital 5 . 1 surround sound . dvd has an running commentary track by the director with comments by stallone . dvd also has technical crew commentary as well . dvd has behind the scenes featurette , two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more . do not miss this great action film . screenplay by micheal france ( fantastic four ) and actor : stallone ( the rocky series ) . based on a premise by john long . excellent cinematography by alex thomson , b . s . c . ( alien³ , demolition man , legend ) . oscar nominated for best sound , best sound editing and best visual effects . panavision . ( * * * * / * * * * * ) . 
POS eric valette is obviously a talented film - maker , and so are the two guys who wrote the script . therefore maléfique is a great flick , made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination . well , i ' m a bit exaggerating , but nevertheless i ' m sincere . so , if you like dark , gory movies , go and see this one . it ' s really worth it . 
POS well , what can i say , other than these people are super in every way . i quite like sharon mcreedy , i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes , i did not realise that they had made so many , i also think that it is a great shame , that they have not made any more . i wish that i got given these powers , imagine me , being knocked off my cycle , somewhere and being knocked out cold , then waking up in a special hospital . later on , i discover that my body has been enhanced . just like richard barrat . these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way , you cannot fight these 3 people , as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry . the music is well written , and to me , puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind , the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats , improved sight , improved hearing and touch . and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon . who i thought was beautiful and intelligent . when i was a boy , i had a huge crush on her ! ! ! ! now i can see why , on my dvd set . the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series . i also thought that trymane was a good boss , firm but he got things done ! 
POS the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly ' s " i ' ll take you there " is not overt , but clearly has ties to his work ( shelly has acted in two of hartley ' s films ) . not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative , but the hyper - stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light . though this film is not ironic on the whole ( thank god ) , the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss . with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies , " i ' ll see you there " is a great indie - film that doesn ' t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion . < br / > < br / > the film begins with bill ' s life falling to pieces . not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home , but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat . all washed up , bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy ( played by the director adrienne shelly ) brings him all kinds of surprises : a self - help book and a " date " for her traumatized brother . < br / > < br / > the unwilling bill tries to refuse , but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice . no doubt bernice ' s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to " rebound " with her . however , her pseudo - hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date . and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him , forcing herself upon him . to what end , we are not aware . . . except for maybe the fact that she is psycho . ( and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy ? ) < br / > < br / > aware that bill desperately wants to see rose , bernice offers her car , but on the condition that he take her somewhere first . on the way , she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun ( a pinkerton detective , no less ) . an imbroglio of angst , resentment , redemption , passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose . . . of course , with a few stops along the way . 
POS the sopranos ( now preparing to end ) is the very peak of adult television and drama . when the sopranos hits the mark , it really hits the mark . using great writing and great actors ( most of them being extras from goodfellas ) the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way . heading up the cast is james gandolfini , who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano , and edie falco , who certainly holds her own . the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary ( usually violence and foul language ) . tony sirico , michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting . seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi ( great ! ) , joe pantoliano ( great ! ) , david proval ( good ) , robert patrick , robert loggia and frank vincent . < br / > < br / > the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv . symbolism and simple story lines , dreams and shoot - outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package . watch it . . . 
POS the sopranos is perhaps the most mind - opening series you could possibly ever want to watch . it ' s smart , it ' s quirky , it ' s funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can ' t resist watching . the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters , set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families . for most of the time , you really don ' t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back , or buy them lunch . < br / > < br / > further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men , most of them murderers , but by god if you don ' t love them too . i ' ve laughed at their wisecracks , been torn when they ' ve made err in judgement , and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal . < br / > < br / > the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show ' s subtext - people aren ' t always as they seem , and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds . < br / > < br / > if you haven ' t already , you most definitely should . 
POS first i would like to say how great this . it is astounding and sometimes shocking . and to say the least i ' m 11 years old and this is my favorite movie , i can definitely stand a boring film , but this is anything but boring . it is like a trip through humanity . its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece . it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers ( voight and hoffman ) who build a mutual friendship . joe buck ( voight ) a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women . soon he meets rico ' ratso ' rizzo ( hoffman ) , who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent . ratso becomes joe ' s ' manager ' but soon both men can ' t find joe a job which results in stealing food . as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is . they can ' t get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party . joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso ' s dream spot , florida . the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film . from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life . 
POS jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy , but hoffman ' s performance , though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman , is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies . as a portrayal of a new york character , only daniel day lewis ' portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable , and day doesn ' t give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso . < br / > < br / > it ' s typical of hoffman ' s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight . i think hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels . < br / > < br / > voight ' s buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether , except that ratso pulls him down - pulls him down , but also teaches him , a lot about how to survive and , more importantly , how to live . < br / > < br / > midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself . i think that , as gritty a movie as it is , it has a very beautiful message , that no matter how much a loser you might be ( ratso clearly defines " loser " ) , if you can find a way to be true to yourself , you are in possession of the secret of life , and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else . < br / > < br / > i can ' t help but compare midnight cowboy to klute , from a few years later , which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape . 
POS midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 , drawing an x rating . by today ' s standards , it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating . jon voight , who has been better , is competent in his role as joe buck , an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city . he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo , who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes . the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic . as ratso , dustin hoffman simply shines . hoffman has often been brilliant , but never more so than in this portrayal . he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison . losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences . director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production , but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer . worth seeing for hoffman ' s performance alone . 
POS young , handsome , muscular joe buck ( jon voight ) moves from texas to new york thinking he ' ll make a living by being a stud . he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn ' t going to be easy - - he goes through one degrading experience after another . at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled , sleazy ratso rizzo ( dustin hoffman ) . together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida . but will they make it ? < br / > < br / > very dark , disturbing yet fascinating movie . director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants . in that way it ' s dated - - the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it ' s cleaned up considerably by now . he also uses every camera trick in the book - - color turning to black & white ; trippy dream sequences ; flash forwards ; flash backs ( especially involving a rape ) ; shock cuts ; weird sound effects . . . you name it . it keeps you disoriented and off center - - but i couldn ' t stop watching . < br / > < br / > there isn ' t much of a story - - it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck . there is an implication that they may have been lovers ( the final shot sort of shows that ) . it ' s just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold , cruel , urban jungle . < br / > < br / > this was originally rated x in 1969 - - the only reason being that the mpaa didn ' t think that parents would want their children to see this . nevertheless , it was a big hit with high schoolers ( back then x meant no one under 17 ) . it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture . hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was ( mysteriously ) sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of ( maybe ) 5 minutes ! it was eventually lowered to an r ( with no cuts ) when it was reissued in 1980 . < br / > < br / > also the excellent song " everybody ' s talkin ' " was introduced in this film - - and became a big hit . < br / > < br / > a great film - - - but very dark . i ' m giving it a 10 . don ' t see it on commercial tv - - it ' s cut to ribbons and incomprehensible . 
POS " pet sematary " succeeds on two major situations . first , it ' s a scary horror movie . those that just aren ' t produced in these days . second , it ' s an emotional , clever movie overall . so if you are looking for chills , scares , creepiness and visually stunning settings , great acting , dialongs , and gruesome effects ; this is the movie you are looking for . a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan . < br / > < br / > probably , the best adaptation to any of king ' s novels . the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel , but that doesn ' t means that this underrated movie isn ' t a complete horror / drama accomplishment . < br / > < br / > stephen king ' s novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time . the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there ' s a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it ' s members . then , when everything seems to be happiness ( technically happy , because the title " pet sematary " does not offers appiness ! ) a tragic event changes the movie ' s atmosphere , now it turns very dark . the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits , but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad , gray , creepy . dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family ' s entire life , and " pet sematary " proves it dramatically . < br / > < br / > the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience , but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot . sadly enough , the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead . the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it ' s something much , much worse . what will happened with the lives of our all american family ? could pascow prevent this tragedy ? what is it with the surreal nightmares ? < br / > < br / > watch " pet sematary " to witness one of the most touching , emotional horror movies of recent times . you won ' t regret . the acting is very good although i didn ' t dig the actor who portrayed the father . he didn ' t seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation . but that ' s just my opinion . denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble , tender mother . baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts . * shivers * . overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people ' s deepest fears . . . the loss of someone you love , the dead returning to life , and a feeling of desperation . < br / > < br / > something is for sure . . . i don ' t wanna be buried , in a pet sematary ! ! 
POS i am a big fan of stephen king ' s work , and this film has made me an even greater fan of king . pet sematary is about the creed family . they have just moved into a new house , and they seem happy . but there is a pet cemetery behind their house . the creed ' s new neighbor jud ( played by fred gwyne ) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery . that burial ground is pure evil . jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being ( or any kind of pet ) up in the burial ground , they would come back to life . the only problem , is that when they come back , they are not the same person , they ' re evil . soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary , everything starts to go to hell . i wont explain anymore because i don ' t want to give away some of the main parts in the film . the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good , but needed a little bit of work . the story was one of the main parts of this movie , mainly because it was so original and gripping . this film features lots of make - up effects that make the movie way more eerie , and frightening . one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back , was in fact the make - up effects . there is one character in this film that is truly freaky . that character is " zelda . " this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise . zelda is rachel creed ' s sister who passed away years before , but rachel is still haunted by her . the first time zelda appears in the movie isn ' t generally scary because she isn ' t talking or anything , but the second time is the worst , and to be honest , the second time scares the living * * * * out of me . there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie , it is almost perfect . pet sematary delivers great scares , some pretty good acting , first rate plot , and mesmerizing make - up . this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time . 10 out of 10 . 
POS this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it ' s easy to see why . even 45 years later , it is quite an impressive piece of work . why it isn ' t in - print is a mystery that only disney can explain . good use of live footage and animation in tandem . this used to run as part of " vault disney " every few months or so , but i haven ' t seen it listed in quite a while . * sigh * most recommended . 
POS this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense . we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen . then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them . we know there will be dynamite in the car , that he will lose a wheel , that the car will have a crash , just to speak of the car . and that is what happens . now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film . that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap . now , how is he going to get out of it ? that ' s what you must discover by yourself . and don ' t worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story . a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river . we also know when he is going to be wounded . they did not know what bullet - proof jackets were in those days . it ' s true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq . but what is the meaning of such a film ? this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem . but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil . why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance ? when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them , to do them . it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive . < br / > < br / > dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines 
POS aim for the top ! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it . i totally loved this series , and to this day , it remains my favorite anime . and while it was not gainax ' s first animated product , it was their first ova series . < br / > < br / > mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970 ' s sports drama aim for the ace ( ace o nerae ! ) , gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 , when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father , who was killed in mankind ' s initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with . it is because of her father ' s death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot . but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters . her friend , kazumi amano , even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot . however , noriko ' s coach , koichiro ota , has faith in her . and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot , for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko ' s father was killed . < br / > < br / > other characters include jung - freud , a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to , smith toren , a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together , and kimiko higuchi , noriko ' s childhood friend . kimiko ' s involvement is also of interest , as while noriko is off in space , kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life . and because of the acts of time dilation , kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school . by the end of the series , noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid - fifties . < br / > < br / > all in all , this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation . if you like hideaki anno ' s other shows , or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto ' s artwork , then give this show a chance . it will grow on you . 
POS for the record , i am not affiliated with the production in any way . < br / > < br / > hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date . over 7 seasons ( this is the last ) they have produced some 50 or so episodes . < br / > < br / > this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy . < br / > < br / > by their own admission , the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects , green screen work and acting all improve . < br / > < br / > i did find it difficult to " dip into " so started from the beginning and watched all the way through . hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set . characters and " relatives " from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories , sometimes improving on the characters over the original . < br / > < br / > the whole experience includes an excellent web site , blooper reels , a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat . < br / > < br / > if you are looking for high definition , high budget productions , this is probably not for you . < br / > < br / > if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think , this is the one . 
POS this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for . i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point . all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception . it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set . betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody . pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching . peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good . even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour , tim healy and jack ellis are spot on . this cast is a theatre impresario ' s dream . the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason . all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole ( non sexual ) love for poppy ( rüdiger weigang - as wonderful as always . his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals . outstanding ! rent it , buy it . love it . 
POS michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name , including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out . iphigenia , however , is a highlight . adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides , it ' s a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel . the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a ' big ' film , with the emphasis placed on the simple story : in supplication to the gods , king agamemnon ( kostas kazakos ) is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia ( tatiana papamoschou ) , much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae ( irene papas ) . kazakos and papas are both outstanding , but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen , blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game . strongly recommended for fans of international cinema . 
POS my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia . my name is eugenia so i thought ok , lets see what this is . i am so glad i stayed on the channel . what a wonderful , wonderful story . drama , sadness , some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had . i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over . give iphigenia a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did . i have even gotten my children ( 27 , 25 , 20 and 17 ) to enjoy it . it starts slow , however , the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story . watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos . 
POS a very interesting entertainment , with the charm of the old movies . tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it , and we all enjoy with him his success . the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills ( he was a great swimmer and had a great shout ) 
POS like tarzan the ape man ( 1932 ) , only more so . there ' s more of everything , more animals , more varied african tribes , and scenes in which the thought must be , if this was good with three or four lions , forty would be better . tarzan wrestles with crocodiles  the the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin , around and around , jaws flapping . tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still . tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals . his friends are real chimps , people wearing larger ape costumes , and elephants . in fact , they use indian elephants  far more friendly and trainable than african ones  with costume ears attached to their heads . the human story : another white man , worse than the rest , shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard . tarzan won ' t show them the way , so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed . tarzan intercedes , and the bad guy shoots him  but , of course , he survives and returns to save jane . everybody else dies , holt and the bad guy and every single one of their " boys . " people are expendable , especially africans , and there doesn ' t seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes . there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude , and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . apparently one of weismuller ' s friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes , and not maureen o ' sullivan . she , however , moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears ( plus a bikini top ) , showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . they still don ' t need to talk a lot . they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . no wonder they ' re happy . 
POS i saw this movie once as a kid on the late - late show and fell in love with it . < br / > < br / > it took 30 + years , but i recently did find it on dvd - it wasn ' t cheap , either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies . we watched it last night for the first time . the audio was good , however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels . even so , it was better than i remembered it . i was also impressed at how true it was to the play . < br / > < br / > the catalog is around here someplace . if you ' re sincere in finding it , fire me a missive and i ' ll see if i can get you the info . cartwrightbride @ yahoo . com 
POS visconti ' s first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique , accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and , best of all , clara calamai as the fabulous , frantic giovanna . remade several times as ' the postman rings twice ' but never bettered . can ' t believe this was the man ' s first film ! it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career . 
POS ( some spoilers ) i have not read the james m . cain novel ( ` the postman always rings twice ' ) on which this movie was based , so i cannot compare this film version to it , but i have seen and love the 1946 us version ( also entitled ` postman ' ) . < br / > < br / > even better is this gem from italy , which , i have read , was ` mutilated ' in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime . well , no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema , apparently the forerunner of the neo - realist movement in film - making . one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on , a pervading sense of societal and cultural , as well as personal oppression remains , hanging heavy over the protagonists , who therefore face many limits in life . < br / > < br / > consider gino , the young drifter , not well educated , unemployed , and resorting to stowing away , stealing and conning people in order to get by , his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless . < br / > < br / > in giovanna , he sees a way out , yet he should have kept going , as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money , her job ( working at the trattoria for her husband , slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen ) , and her sex . in the past , she had limited options , and decided to marry the restaurant / gas station owner ( giuseppe bregana , played by juan de landa ) anyway , knowing that he would not make her happy . she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her . < br / > < br / > on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part ( which he has in fact pocketed ) , gino wins bregana ' s favor ( promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life , or lack thereof ) and is left alone with giovanna . they immediately start a heated , passionate , yet volatile love affair . < br / > < br / > gino soon feels stifled by the relationship , and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband . wanting no part of it , gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford , kindly paid for him by another gypsy - type man named spagnolo , a fellow train passenger . to gino , spagnolo represents a sort of freedom , and they become friends ( spagnolo also symbolizes gino ' s morality and conscience ) , traveling and finding work at a carnival together . finally gino has steady employment . to his dismay ( he is not yet over his love for giovanna ) , a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go ` back home ' to live and work with them again , as he is handy to have around . < br / > < br / > too weak - willed to resist , knowing this will reunite he and giovanna , gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple . after a while he gives in to gina ' s demands to get rid of her husband . once the evil deed is done , giovanna becomes more cold - blooded than ever , seeming to have very little conscience , while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm . as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly , they are now inextricably linked , and must face the consequences . < br / > < br / > i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino ' s life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good , and interesting , adding another dimension to the story . < br / > < br / > while the ' 46 u . s . version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters , especially the cops and the lawyers , ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone . this gives the final outcome even more potency , and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live . < br / > < br / > a minor quibble : the amount of time ( hardly any ) that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers , how quickly they kill the husband ( there is no botched first attempt as in the u . s . version ) ; gino ' s very quick - to - escalate relationship with the dancer / hooker  they quickly profess their love as well , and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met !  all rather unrealistic , isn ' t it ? i found this time - frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere . otherwise , well worth the viewer ' s time . the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout . recommended . 
POS this anime seriously rocked my socks . when the anime first opened itself , i felt it was too slow ; the story wasn ' t quite moving forward , and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead . once he learns more about tracing , and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself , the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together . it was fantastic . < br / > < br / > additionally , i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop , in the real world . there wasn ' t any stupid completely obvious things going on ; the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch , but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on . a few of the " surprise " people that show up ( gilgamesh ? ) seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another , meaning we didn ' t have " generic bad - ass a " being replaced by " generic bad - ass b " as soon as a died . < br / > < br / > anddd , i loved the music . the opening music rocked , and the finishing theme from the final episode just . . . seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more . good job , type - moon ! 
POS when i first heard about this series on animetv , i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen , this one tops it all off . i had to see this show , and that is what i really did . when i got the first volume of this show , it was the best . i really liked the animation , and all the fight scenes were awesome . i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber , and archer and of course i also like illya . and of course , all the episodes on the volumes were interesting , and very cool . another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie ( famous for transformers , and others ) playing the voice of berserker . he does have a cool character . and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume . so if you to see something good , then see this show , it ' s the best . 
POS i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s - and it stayed with me ! it ' s charming , loud , colourful - a great kids film . i put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la " meet the feebles " but no - its wholesome clean fun . < br / > < br / > jack wild is in fine form , as is mama cass , and the somehow attractive witchy poo . < br / > < br / > if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30 ' s this will re - create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe ! < br / > < br / > even if i ' ve realised now that puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away ! quality tv movie - if , like me , you are into death metal - you ' ll love it ! 
POS chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a ` jack - the - stripper ' type of list of murdered people : he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results . perhaps mostly due to stephen rea ' s excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both . it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov . supporting actors , especially max von sydow , carried out their parts really well . good directing . the photography was good too . needless to say , the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations , but , frankly , given the depth of the story - telling and interpretations , we can completely forget these little trivialia . < br / > < br / > for once , a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps . recommended , especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which , i hasten to add , are never exaggerated . 
POS i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa . they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court . not , as it turned out , to protect the court members , but to protect him from the public . this was fascinating , albeit morbid , reading . i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case , but it was made for american tv . bummed ! strangely , citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa . i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket ( i was alone ; my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes ) . wow ! what a brilliant film . why wasn ' t it released to a wider audience ? had it not been made for tv , it could have got an oscar nomination or 2 . there is no way to spoil the ending ; who the killer is is never kept from the audience . jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho . he is calm , downtrodden , considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work . by committing these horrendous acts , he gets to feel strong , powerful . < br / > < br / > fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist , played to excellent turn by stephen rea , in one of his strongest performances . he must battle the snail - pace of russian bureaucracy , the primitive resources he has at his disposal and ( above all ) the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer . the general in charge ( joss ackland ) says that serial killers are " a decadent , western phenomenon " . only donald sutherland is willing to help , but his help must be under the counter . the ever - brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest . it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose , and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public . < br / > < br / > citizen x is brilliantly acted , well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film . excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing . this was too good to be made for tv 
POS the dazzling seventeen - minute dance sequence of george gershwin ' s 1928 orchestral piece , " an american in paris " , is an indisputable masterwork . choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by gene kelly , the vibrant combination of color , music and dance is still eye - poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists - dufy in the opening place de la concorde piece , manet in the flower market , utrillo in a paris street , rousseau at the fair , vincent van gogh in the spectacular place de l ' opera piece , and toulouse - lautrec for the moulin rouge where kelly wears his famous white bodysuit . the 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting , not by a long shot , but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 oscar - winning musical . < br / > < br / > director vincente minnelli and screenwriter alan jay lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry mulligan , a former g . i . who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter . with his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style , gene kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality , but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree jerry . the love - triangle plot is focused on jerry ' s involvement with milo roberts , a self - proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists . on their first date in a crowded montmartre nightclub , jerry unapologetically falls for lise , a young woman who turns out to be the fiancée of henri , a professional entertainer and friend of jerry ' s pal , adam , an out - of - work concert pianist . romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performed . < br / > < br / > the best of these is the most imitated - a swooningly romantic song and dance to " our love is here to stay " along a faux - seine river in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights . the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch . few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love . " i got rhythm " and " s ' wonderful " spotlight kelly ' s nimble tap - dancing and agreeable singing , while " embraceable you " is danced impressively by caron in a five - scene montage of henri ' s all - over - the - map description of lise to adam . designed to show off caron ' s dancing versatility , the sequence is similar to the one in " on the town " where vera - ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kelly ' s sailor character described his multi - faceted vision of miss turnstiles . < br / > < br / > as lise , the nineteen year - old caron ( in her first film ) dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years . looking quite glamorous , nina foch plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate , while oscar levant is just his sardonic self as adam . performing an elegant " i ' ll build a stairway to paradise " , george guétary plays henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end . this is not the best all - around mgm musical , but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile . the 2000 dvd contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras . 
POS i have been a fan of this movie for years and years . because of teri hatchers move into the forefront , i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it . why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me ? sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous . although i never have watching daytime soap operas , this movie kills me every time i watch it . the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart . i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven ' t already . you will get to see elizabeth shue , whoopi goldberg , teri hatcher , and carrie fisher . . . to name a few . . . all give splendid performances . 
POS gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm . here he ' s at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit . hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm . < br / > < br / > the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots . the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin ' s tone poem an american in paris . it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material . < br / > < br / > gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got . not one note of non - gershwin music is heard in an american in paris . listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers . < br / > < br / > another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics , alan jay lerner , wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one . all about an ex - gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france , just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist . he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy . < br / > < br / > two women are interested in him . another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he ' ll reciprocate in other matters . but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut . caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here . < br / > < br / > of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin . an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took . i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i ' ve got rhythm . my favorite number in the film however is tra - la - la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano . at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano . < br / > < br / > in a book about arthur freed , i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot . so it happened that way . kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music , the pirate , and on the town . but this one topped them all . still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly ' s later films . < br / > < br / > in a surprise upset at the oscars , an american in paris was chosen best picture for 1951 , beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire . i guess fantasy trumped realism that year . big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well . < br / > < br / > still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof , something less likely to be repeated . 
POS a great storyline with a message . joan plowright is superb as " phoebe " , mike kopsa is hilarious as " coach " and richard de klerk plays the role of " carmine " superbly . mischa barton as " frankie " puts in a good performance and ingrid as " hazel " plays her first lead extremely well . this film is superbly directed by jo - beth williams . the editing is first rate . 
POS i first saw this film during and international film studies course . i am a ' non - traditional ' student , and , perhaps for reasons of years - lived or wisdom - accrued , appreciated the slow , reflective pacing of the film ' s narrative . languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime , the story is deeply psychological , replete with multi - layered symbolism , and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the ' other ' in a land that one does not understand . the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider . made nearly 20 years ago , it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces , clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered . much more lavishly filmed - - - and heavily financed - - - works that have been made since reflect the same themes : indochine , nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make chocolat seem pale and boring . it has no adrenaline - pumping action or extreme violence . the struggles are mental , emotional and subtle . but , that being said , it is a fine film , worth a viewing . 
POS you ' ll probably never see it , but the uncut version is about 50 % better than the one you can buy . put it another way : once you ' ve seen it in its original form , the current version is only half as good . < br / > < br / > it ' s still wildly creative and sick , a total success on so many levels . < br / > < br / > 
POS this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today , if it weren ' t for advances in cgi . and that ' s just to say that he ' d be forgotten , too , if technology hadn ' t made things sexy and kewl since 1983 . _twice . . . _ has got the same wit , imagination , and sense of real excitement that you ' d find in a pixar flick , only executed under the restrictions of the medium c . 1983 . innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels . it should be spoken of in the same breath with _spiritited away_ and _toy story_ . 
POS a new way to enjoy goldsworthy ' s work , rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion . watching goldsworthy build his pieces , one develops an appreciation for every stone , leaf , and thorn that he uses . goldsworthy describes how the flow of life , the rivers , and the tides inspires and affects his work . although , i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy ' s pieces ( no snowballs ) , i do feel it was a bit long . the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy ' s work to life , and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch . 
POS soapdish may go down as one of the single most under - rated movies ever made . < br / > < br / > a stellar , unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it . while everyone hammed it up , there was no one - upmanship . kline showed wit and great physical comedy , goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking , i could just go on . < br / > < br / > do not pass this movie by ! 
POS high school friends andre kriegman and cal gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school . as they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge , the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission . < br / > < br / > there is another similar movie like this , called " elephant . " why do i bring this up ? to compare the two films , of course . i have to say , even though i liked " elephant , " this is a much better film . what ' s the difference , you ask ? well , for starters , this is shot differently , much along the lines of " cloverfield , " " blair witch project , " and " diary of the dead . " this makes the movie all the better because it ' s much more painfully realistic . < br / > < br / > but what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the " other side of the story . " you get to know these two shooters , unlike " elephant . " i actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did . this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that ' s a good thing because it ' s not always black and white . < br / > < br / > to be honest , this is why i almost cried in this movie . the characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions . you get to understand them . it ' s not like they want to kill people for attention . overall , this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than " elephant . " 
POS saw this movie at the rotterdam iff . you may question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie sure hits you in the gut . especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch . hope it gets the distribution it deserves . 
POS weak scripts at times ? yep ! cheesy special effects at times ? yep ! deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time ? yep ! more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin ? yep ! i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid , but found so much of the dracula / frankenstein / mummy / horror stuff as just so much crap . it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters , and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the " dark side " of entertainment . the duke had rooster cogburn , eastwood had dirty harry , garner had maverick and rockford , selleck had magnum , and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak . mixed in with all those weak scripts , cheesy special effects , that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars , there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak . he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger , was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth , and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover - up by government officials . additionally , unlike 98 % of us , kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done , even if it meant his demise , the end of his journalistic career , or jail time . for all his faults , including no taste in clothes , carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang ( which was an old used car at the time ) on his way to save the day for humanity . as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin . now that he ' s passed on and his show is on dvd , i hope he ' s having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again ! 
POS a frolics of youth short subject . < br / > < br / > a teenager , embarrassed by his fear of dogs , runs away from home . the abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind . < br / > < br / > pardon my pups is an enjoyable little film , with shirley temple stealing all her scenes as the hero ' s lively kid sister . the opening gag - dealing with bedwetting - is in poor taste , but is quickly forgotten . highlight : the climactic fisticuffs , which look impressively realistic . < br / > < br / > often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two - reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios ' feature films . 
POS it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings . by using the adjective ' shocking ' i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them , it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off , either with or without a ' reason ' . < br / > < br / > the first part of the film focuses on hanna ' s successful participation in the hungarian resistance . maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance , due to inconsistent directing , but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma . she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy . her very beautiful looks help , of course , but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress , playing a good part . < br / > < br / > certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hanna ' s war . i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan ( often despised for the gianni versace murder ) was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene . on the other hand , i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought - provoking film and as i am very positive about it , i think he did a good job . < br / > < br / > the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one . it focuses on hanna ' s suffering ( beware of donald pleasence ' s scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza ) and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war . i receive hanna ' s war , especially the second half , as a strong anti - war film and for that alone golan deserves credit . it is also this second half in which maruschka detmer ' s talent comes out , creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking , strong and tragic ever portrayed . it is also great to see ellen burstyn , whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider , who - had she been alive and cast - would have made a similar effective contribution to hanna ' s war . < br / > < br / > the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected , so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears . and when i realized once more it wasn ' t even fiction , it all actually happened , i found myself in even more tears . the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever . 
POS i ' ve also been looking to find this movie for quite some time , and how great it would be to find it on dvd . . . < br / > < br / > i saw this movie when i was about 6 years old , in the netherlands . and i was very impressed by it . it was shown before walt disney ' s jungle book ! < br / > < br / > what i remember of this movie is fragmented . i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle . this impressed me very much . for some reason he was thrown out of his village ( did not grasp the reason for this ) . when other boys threw stones at him , he climbed a rock and jumped off . at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend . as an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace . < br / > < br / > cb 
POS this show is awesome ! i have been a fan since it premiered , and it only keeps me watching . . . i ' ve seen some terrible things here , that i wish i hadn ' t , but , it really shows you how addiction affects all involved , not just the addict . you can see all kinds of different addictions , from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict , or the eating disorder addict . and actually , it ' s really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also . we ' ve seen accomplished musicians , an nba player , and even young people , who really need the help . and since they have started showing a few follow - ups , that ' s been awesome too . now , you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired . if you haven ' t checked this one out , please do . it ' s on a & e , and it ' s awesome ! the new eps are sunday nights at 10pm est , if i remember correctly . . . so set your tivo ! 
POS i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one . the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it . this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn ' t automatically just get better . she gets better and then has a drawback . i think this movie shows more than the others that i ' ve seen that getting better doesn ' t just happen , it ' s hard work and takes time , it ' s a long path to recovery . i think this movie shows all of that very well . there should be more movies like this . 
POS the planning episodes were a bit dull , but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch . the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because , much to my surprise , charley fell out of the race relatively early . when his hands were sore , i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix , but instead he actually quit the race . the most anxious moment of the show must ' ve been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food ! the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it . overall , not as great as the long way round , but definitely an interesting watch , as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world . 
POS tony arzenta , a sicilian hit - man or professional killer , decides to leave the business , and his former employers do not agree . in terms of content , this highly enjoyable action movie doesn ' t have one ; in terms of sheer amusement , it is fun  it is very melodramatic , violent , quite brutal , the car chases are notable . " arzenta " is an unpretentious , yet very likable film  much better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label . it comes from delon ' s rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the ' 70s . it carefully uses delon ' s tough guy persona , belonging to the gallery of bad - ass thugs that he made in his youth . < br / > < br / > i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film , that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick . < br / > < br / > the score is very fine , with a good introductory song  making felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work , where the musical art has an important part . < br / > < br / > in tony arzenta / big guns / no way out the very appealing erika blanc ( 31 years in ' 73 ) appears as an unnamed hooker . meanwhile , arzenta ' s girlfriend , sandra , is played by carla gravina ( a starlet that practically left the movies after ' 75 ) . < br / > < br / > " arzenta " is interestingly filmed  an ambitious visual conception , some expressionistic peculiar angles . the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari , the one who made also zorro ( the delon comedy ) . needless to mention that these two films , tony arzenta ( 1973 ) and zorro , are very unlike . the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie - - the second is a lighthearted comedy , more kindred to a spoof , though remarkably coherent and skilfully made . duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss . . . bang bang ( 1966 ) , sons of satan , the bloodstained butterfly , ¡ viva la muerte . . . tua ! , tough guys ( 1974 ) , safari express ( 1976 ) , etc . . 
POS obviously , there wasn ' t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production . but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot . i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other ( great ) chinese films . i first saw this when i was 14 years old , i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything . . . 
POS tripping over . i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes , but having faith in the show , and abe forsythe ' s unquestionable talent , i continued to watch . i can safely say i ' m now glad that i did . the story did develop quite well , and all the characters have a strong base , and most don ' t have any information missing . < br / > < br / > the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie . < br / > < br / > some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line . here ' s to hoping for another season ! 
POS the film did not do well at the box office . < br / > < br / > i saw it in a sneak preview . < br / > < br / > i have always enjoyed the film . < br / > < br / > i live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to . < br / > < br / > not the best film ever put to screen , but enjoyable . < br / > < br / > robin did well with his role . < br / > < br / > best line of the film at the beginning , by robin ' s character jack : " i was that sob ! " cleaned up here as not to offend anyone . < br / > < br / > was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screen / letter box format . < br / > < br / > i am not a football fan or a real sports fan . but , you do not need to be one to like this film . 
POS robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their 30 ' s who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding ( russell somewhat reluctantly ) to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival bakersfield years after the fact . williams is ok , but russell is flat - out great as legendary taft quarterback remo hightower . holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as williams ' wife , who could live without this rematch . film is worth watching just to see the famed remo in action . highly recommended . 
POS i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point . and that ' s exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee ( robin williams ) intends to do in " the best of times " . yep , the man who went all crazy with the radio in " good morning , vietnam " is playing football . in this case , he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title . but ex - teammate reno hightower ( kurt russell ) isn ' t just going to go along with it so easily . < br / > < br / > granted , it ' s not the best movie for either man . but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team . and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles ( to say the least ) . check it out . 
POS this movie surprised me , it had good one - liners and laughs , + a nonstop action - packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions . this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns . the plot is solid despite what others may think , it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end . in conclusion ; this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on . 
POS in another one of bugs bunny ' s hare - raisingly wacky shorts , the famous leporid * works in a department store display case , when owner gildersleeve decides to stuff him . of course , this proves nearly impossible , as bugs apparently knows the store better than gildersleeve ( and knows when to cross - dress ) . as always , they keep everything coming at top speed , and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted ! among other things , " hare conditioned " is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the ' 40s before the termite terrace crowd polished them . but don ' t get me wrong , the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived . < br / > < br / > anyway , this is a great one . < br / > < br / > * leporids are rabbits and hares . 
POS rock star : inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched ! it had some of the greatest rock n ' roll songs ever written , performed by 15 very talented singers / performers . it also had ( in my opinion ) the most heart - felt , feel - good , surprise endings in all of reality tv . it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner ! ! ! over the 13 weeks of this televised competition , the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants . after 30 - some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show . and the fact that inxs was , and still is , one of the greatest rock n ' roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series . if you don ' t have the series recorded , rock star : inxs the dvd is a great alternative . 
POS david lynch ' s new short is a very " lynchian " piece , full of darkness , tension , silences , discreet but very textured background music , and features again two beautiful actresses , a blonde and a brunette , a recurrent theme in his work . < br / > < br / > both characters create a very intriguing slave - mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in mulholland dr . < br / > < br / > beautiful . for lynch fan ' s . < br / > < br / > 
POS this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch , and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people . this is your typical lynch short . a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room . the blonde has been crying , the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde , and that ' s about it . < br / > < br / > with a lot of silent moments , but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti , there is a strange form of suspense . this short feels a little like ' mulholland dr . ' , a movie i loved , and therefore i liked this one as well . it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this . 
POS love it or loathe it , it ' s hard to not find warren beatty ' s take on " dick tracy , " the 1990 film adaptation of chester gould ' s famous comic strip , anything short of a genre classic . superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years , and may soon become a genre all on its own . < br / > < br / > beatty ' s film liberally uses gould ' s source material to full effect , shooting in all six of the strip ' s primary colors , and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger - happy mutant gangsters and loose , seductive women a lush visual style and tone . < br / > < br / > it can be stated that the film ' s strong visual aesthetics drastically short - change the characters and their acting abilities , which i don ' t think can be any further from the truth . < br / > < br / > " dick tracy " relishes in its look and ghastly characters , and beatty himself , who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title , is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs . < br / > < br / > other than the visual treats and oscar - winning makeup , there is a plot , and big boy caprice ( al pacino , deliciously over - the - top in an oscar - nominated performance ) , seeks to eliminate tracy in one well - planned move , but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him . < br / > < br / > tracy , meanwhile , is juggling his relationship with tess trueheart ( glenne headly ) , who as her name would have it , remains faithfully by his side and cares for the kid ( charlie korsmo ) , who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime - busting hero . tracy ' s fidelity to tess is tested by the tempting advances of breathless mahoney ( madonna ) , who is also big boy ' s main squeeze . at the same time that all of this is going down , things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town , and decides to play both sides against the middle . < br / > < br / > the performances are good , as beatty ' s focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material , as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects . pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that ' s truly standout from the rest . < br / > < br / > " dick tracy " is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre . i think that if chester gould was still alive , he would be proud of warren beatty ' s take on his beloved crime - fighting detective . < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 
POS most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life , ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog . the tim burton batmans had it , as did ( in an even more grotesque manner ) sin city . with dick tracy producer / director / star warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework . like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures - only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde - dick tracy is filled , joyfully , with archetypes and bright , primary colors , where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities . villains like the stooge , shoulders , lips , the brow , mumbles , the blank , pruneface , spud . chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles , and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass . the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously . < br / > < br / > if , at the time , movies like batman and ( underrated ) teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic - book outline , dick tracy is more ' old - school ' . it ' s a story of cops and crooks , or rather a cop , detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy ( al pacino , in what is arguably his biggest performance to date , and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style ) , but with no such luck . there ' s also a little kid , called simply the kid ( charlie korsmo , who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would ' ve been imagined ) , and tracy ' s love interest in tess . and then there ' s the nightclub ' dame ' ( madonna , who probably doesn ' t give any kind of great acting performance , but maybe that suits the role fine , and she sings excellently when called upon ) , who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesn ' t have for her . then there ' s convoluted dealings with taking tracy down , and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice . < br / > < br / > meantime , as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions , dick tracy adds on the wink - and - nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes . it ' s a wonder to look at this world , which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers ( i . e . sin city , which can be justifiably compared to beatty ' s film ) . we ' re driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line , or whatever there is of it , in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old . i ' m almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences , as story , music , detail , and a few big punches and gun - shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said , which , actually , isn ' t more than it needs to . and there ' s a heap - load of catchy dialog from the script ( one of my favorites : " the enemy of my enemy is . . . my enemy " , plus any of pacino ' s references to other figures in quotes ) . < br / > < br / > revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater ( and only remembering little bits ) , dick tracy is a hard - boiled fantasy to the finest degree . it ' s filled with good cheer for the kids , and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic - book movies ( i . e . pg - 13 fare ) , and for the adults its throw - back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle . even dustin hoffman hams it up , and he barely says an audible word ! 
POS i love horses and admire hand drawn animation , so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit : stallion of the cimarron . i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed . you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story . a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature . the animals don ' t sing cute songs or even talk - - a major plus . sadly , the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon ; a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams ; and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production . if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity , we ' d have a masterpiece here . this is not a great film , but it is good entertainment for small children . i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn ' t offensive to small children . not bad , but could have been much better . very pretty visuals though . 
POS a man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage . he also has to solve the problem of the family milch cow , tulip , which refuses to allow itself to be milked . until , that is , he visualizes his wife who was the one who used to milk tulip . < br / > < br / > tulip is based on a real story told in griffith ' s family , of her grandparents ' generation . the film is a nostalgic look back at a disappearing way of life , one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other , set in the lush green victorian ( the australian state , not the era ) countryside . < br / > < br / > writer and director griffiths evidently has further ambitions in both areas , and this multiple award - winning 15 - minute short is a fine beginning to her reel . 
POS spirit : stallion of the cimarron is an overall wonderful movie . the blending of animation types is unique , the storyline is amazing , and the music is wonderful . < br / > < br / > the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations . how they expressed the characters , especially the horses , through their animation are spectacular especially . while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand , many young children and people who haven ' t studied horses might not understand . without words , i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features . because of this , i understand the ' eyebrow ' they added to the horses ( while real horses don ' t have those thick lines ) . one of the few things i noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother ' s herd . in wild horse herds , the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out . < br / > < br / > also , while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the ' bad guys ' is stereotyping , think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that . sometimes back then ; they did treat mustangs very poorly . for example , in real history , the appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers . imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the native americans had not saved them . < br / > < br / > i think it ' s amazing how the realism wasn ' t subtracted by making the horses talk to each other . spirit ' s feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration , but mostly through the music ( by bryan adams ) . the songs express the story really well , and hans zimmer and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics . < br / > < br / > the emotion i got when watching the movie , whether the first time or the twentieth ( yes , i ' ve watched it that much ) , you wouldn ' t believe . some of the scenes take your breath away , while others seem to force tears into your eyes . the opening sequence , showing spirit ' s homeland , puts you right into the spectacular action right away . < br / > < br / > i don ' t understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie . overall , i rate it a 10 / 10 - a must watch . 
POS life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard . the acting is rather amateurish , at best . the special effects are obviously low budget , but not too bad . the story line is rather stock , but with an interesting twist . computer run amok , but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed . still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable . for me , at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell . she may not be the greatest actress in the world , but having been a former playmate of the month , she is cute enough . in all life pod is much like other low - budget sci - fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable . < br / > < br / > the white star lines bit is cute , if completely inaccurate . the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic ( not the sister of titanic ) which was sold for scrap in 1960 . 
POS written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma , scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten . al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana , a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida . this gangster flick is harsh , violent , loud , gross , unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word " f - - k " the most number of times . almost three hours long , and yes it can get repulsive . a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord . < br / > < br / > also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer , steven bauer , robert loggia , mary elizabeth mastrantonio , f . murray abraham and angel salazar . pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation . he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression . this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster . is that powerful enough for you ? crime does not pay for long ! 
POS every great gangster movie has under - currents of human drama . don ' t expect an emotional story of guilt , retribution and despair from " scarface " . this is a tale of ferocious greed , corruption , and power . the darker side of the fabled " american dream " . < br / > < br / > anybody complaining about the " cheesiness " of this film is missing the point . the superficial characters , cheesy music , and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess . nothing in the lives of these characters really matter , not on any human level at least . in fact the film practically borderlines satire , ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana . < br / > < br / > this isn ' t brian depalma ' s strongest directorial effort , it is occasionally excellent and well - handled ( particularly the memorable finale ) , but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled . thankfully , it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone ( probably good therapy for him , considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time ) . the themes are consistent , with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana , and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power . the dialogue is also excellent , see - sawing comfortably between humour and drama . there are many stand - out lines , which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another . < br / > < br / > the cast help make it what it is as well , but this is really pacino ' s film . one of his earlier less subtle performances ( something much more common from him nowadays ) , this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico . yet he is as watchable here as ever , in very entertaining ( and intentionally over - the - top ) form . it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film , in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever . pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing , but i ' ve come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife . not an exceptional effort , but unfairly misjudged . the supporting players are very good too , particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosa . < br / > < br / > powerful , occasionally humorous , sometimes shocking , and continually controversial . " scarface " is one of the films of the eighties ( whatever that might mean to you ) . an essential and accessible gangster flick , and a pop - culture landmark . 9 / 10 
POS it is projected that between 2000 and 2020 , 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of aids . the projected toll is greatest in sub - saharan africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected . beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about . christophe honoré describes one of the most moving in close to leo , a film produced for french television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people . though fictional , it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common - - the effect of a diagnosis of hiv on a loving close - knit family . < br / > < br / > when twenty one - year old leo ( pierre mignard ) tells his parents and two teenage brothers , tristan ( rodolphe pauley ) and pierrot ( jeremie lippmann ) that he has aids , the family is devastated . out of concern for his youth , they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother , 12 - year old marcel ( yannis lespert ) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically . when leo goes to paris for treatment , he takes marcel with him but the young boy confronts leo and demands to know the truth . leo tells him that he is ill and marcel is sad but accepting . when he brings marcel along to meet some former gay friends , however , tension between them boils to the surface , setting the stage for a riveting conclusion . < br / > < br / > although i was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers , i feel that the sincerity of close to leo and the brilliant performances by lespert and mignard more than tip the scales in its favor . seeing events unfold from the young boy ' s perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the quebecois film leolo and truffaut ' s the 400 blows . unlike some american films that dance around the anguish of aids , close to leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real . 
POS this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle . he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s - 1960s that he sold with gimmicks . in " 13 ghosts " you need viewers to see the ghosts ( they were in color , the film was in b & w ) . " the tingler " had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre . " marabre " issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death ! the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them . in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle , actors in his movies and his daughter . it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was ( by all accounts he was a great guy ) . the documentary is affectionate , very funny and absolutely riveting . it ' s very short ( under 90 minutes ) and there ' s never a dull moment . a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans . my one complaint - - there were very few sequences shown from his pictures . that aside this is just great . 
POS this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive ' 50s - ' 60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work - - look at the funny , silly people with the ghost - glasses - - but it ' s also affectionate and lively , with particularly bright commentary from john waters , who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time , and from castle ' s daughter , who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft . ( we never find out what became of the other castle offspring . ) the movies were not very good , it makes clear , but his marketing of them was brilliant , and he appears to have been a sweet , hardworking family man . fun people keep popping up , like " straight jacket " ' s diane baker , who looks great , and anne helm , whom she replaced at the instigation of star joan crawford . darryl hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with castle on " the tingler , " and there ' s enough footage to give us an idea of the level of castle ' s talent - - not very high , but very energetic . a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased , and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie - going days . 
POS this is an excellent film for female body - builder & female action fans ! i think that sue price did a great job in this film series ( nemesis 2 , 3 , 4 ) and proved to be a great fighter . she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula ( nemesis 2 ) . though not a film of great value and sue price ' s acting skills not the best to have met in my life , the movie itself was something awesome , a priceless gem for fans of female body - builder action ! well , some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci - fi films , such as terminator or predator , but that ' s not the point . the point is that a . puyn casted in that film a very talented body - builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do . i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 ( a rather boring sequel ) and nemesis 4 ( a much more interesting sequel than 3 ) . what a pity it hasn ' t shown yet on dvd : - ( 
POS the memory of the " the last hunt " has stuck with me since i saw it in 1956 when i was 13 . it is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives , the environment , and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed . it is as relevant today as in 1956 , a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance . to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent . the memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days . 
POS as a baseball die - hard , this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie : authentic - looking sports action , believable characters , and an original story line . while " angels in the outfield " fails miserably in the first category , it succeeds beautifully in the latter two . " angels " weaves the story of roger and j . p . , two anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family , with that of the woebegone angels franchise , struggling to draw fans and win games . pushed by his deadbeat father ' s promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant , roger asks for some heavenly help , and gets it in the form of diamond - dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise ' s downward spiral . and , when short - fused manager george knox ( portrayed by danny glover ) begins believing in what roger sees , the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around - - and roger and j . p . find something to believe in . glover in particular gives a nice performance , and tony danza , playing a washed - up pitcher , also does well , despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the windup ! 
POS i try to watch it everyday most of the time , and even though i have watched it for the past 4 years , i have not seen every episode . < br / > < br / > the show is about danny tanner who is guy who does news for sports . his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse , an elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair . joey , an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls , donna joe , they call her d . j . , stephinie who is the second oldest and michelle , the youngest . < br / > < br / > they all live under one roof with no one to help them out . < br / > < br / > later in the show , jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins , nicki and alex . ( this starts to happen in the new seasons ) this show is awesome , if you like the suite life of zack and cody , that ' s so raven , boy meets world , and designing woman , you will love this . ( it starts to get better in the ending seasons ) watch it , you will love it ! 
POS this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave . it even surpasses his wonderful performance as " johnny eager " coming a full 14 years after that film . his looks are still a wonder to see , but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty , violent role . charlie gilson ( taylor ) is the last of his breed , a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure . his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings , is stunning to watch . he is basically a lonely man , needing the people around him , but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior . his partner is sandy mckenzie ( stewart granger ) who is sick of the hunt , and only goes along , because he is a failure at anything else . along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra pagent . charlie tries to seduce her to no avail , but sees that sandy is interested in her also . granger is kind of sad to watch , so fed up with the hunt , longing to go away with the girl and her baby . lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing . russ tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world . the group is an odd mix of good and evil , young and old . in the end taylor gets spooked by the buffalo , as many hunters before him had , and runs off leaving sandy with the girl . upon his return , that night sandy leaves with the woman , setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself . the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it . it is taylor ' s film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era . 
POS brilliant kung - fu scenes , loads of melodrama , peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy ( ? ) end makes barefoot kid an unforgettable film . < br / > < br / > one of the silliest subtitles i ' ve seen . . . 
POS this hard - hitting , often violent western in the peckinpah / leone tradition is surprisingly directed by andrew v . mclaglen , whose previous westerns ( particularly those that starred john wayne ) were mainly in the john ford mode . it is both surprisingly traditional ( good guys / bad guys ) and incredible up - to - date as well . < br / > < br / > heston portrays a former captain of the arizona territorial police who has been in retirement for a year , having turned over the law enforcement reins to a reform - minded sheriff ( michael parks ) and finding his ways of enforcing the law being taken over by autos , telegraphs , telephones , and the railroad in the first years of the 20th century . but soon he is confronted with a menace from his past - - a half - breed outlaw ( coburn ) that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards . in a subsequent shootout , coburn ' s wife was killed ; and so coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge . it involves the kidnapping and , eventually , the rape of heston ' s daughter ( hershey ) by him and his gang . the result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern arizona . < br / > < br / > the last hard men , based on brian garfield ' s novel " gun down " , is violent in many places , including the showdown between heston and coburn , and the rape scene involving hershey and two members of coburn ' s gang ( quade , paull ) is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in straw dogs and deliverance . but that doesn ' t detract too terribly much from the film ' s psychological approach to the western genre . mclaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant panache , and heston ' s performance as an aging lawman was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his 1970s films . coburn makes for an especially cold - blooded heavy , and both parks and chris mitchum ( as hershey ' s intended husband ) do good turns as well . the music here is cribbed from jerry goldsmith ' s scores to 100 rifles and the 1966 remake of stagecoach , but it still works here . < br / > < br / > wisely filmed totally on location in southeastern arizona , and utilizing the old tucson set , the last hard men needs to be released by fox on vhs and / or dvd soon . it is a western that deserves nothing less . 
POS the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin . < br / > < br / > the main protagonist / antagonist jennifer stanton ( hart ) is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father ( baldwin ) . however , when she meets an ex con called nick ryan ( jeremy jordan " never been kissed " ) they instantly ' fall ' for each other , but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship . she manipulates him to kill her parents , to protect their ' love ' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad ( david lascher future ' sabrina ' cast mate for hart ) . melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder . the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time . i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year , hart , began portrayed sabrina , the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television . < br / > < br / > although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to ' nine dead ' that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called " clarissa darling " or sabrina spellman " < br / > < br / > i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina . you can watch this on the internet , so i suggest check it out . 
POS twisted desire ( 1996 ) was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart . melissa ' s character , jennifer stanton , a seventeen - year - old seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents . the movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old jessica wiseman . jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents ! thomas was executed in 2000 ! jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old . evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother . jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia . 
POS the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects . it ' s scary , suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life . i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 , and with all the lights off and the volume turned up , it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life . i managed to get hold of a copy , and now , i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members , who have no idea what they ' re in for , and all i can do is laugh with glee . as for the film : < br / > < br / > it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps , who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - mrs . alice drablow . < br / > < br / > this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story . but then , arthur attends the funeral , and from that scene on , we do not feel safe . we are constantly on edge and biting our nails , and that goes on for the next hour or so , until the final , thrilling finale . < br / > < br / > a warning to all new viewers though : do not watch this alone . . . 
POS i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films . if ismail merchant and james ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one , save for the lack of an internationally known , top drawer cast . this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn , and you don ' t even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers . bravo to director herbert wise , writers susan hill and nigel kneale , top production design by jon bunker , art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though i ' m living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century . i gave it a " 9 " out of " 10 " because with the production and budget constraints of television , they really pulled of a great show . 
POS the woman in black ( 1989 ) is a tv adaptation of susan hill ' s modern classic ghost story , published only a few years earlier than the film was made . sadly , this film has not been released on dvd , and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs . it ' s availability is in direct contrast to it ' s popularity amongst those in the know about horror films . the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow , who died on her isolated marshland estate . what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death , and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest . the story is told in a subtle but concise way , never being self - indulgent , flashy or over - expositional . the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no - nonsense approach , but it ' s just what the story needs , and why it works so well . it ' s what you don ' t see that scares . having said that , there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual , and it works to perfection . i watched this film during the day , and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later . if you love being terrified , do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black . 
POS it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein ( and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death , we may never know ) , but in their lifetime the opportunity was there . < br / > < br / > scripted by terry johnson from his own play , nicolas roeg ' s insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus joe dimaggio ( busey ) , and senator joseph mccarthy ( curtis ) - but only on one level . on another level , it elevates - or reduces - these ' personalities ' ( and what a lousy phrase that is ) to mere avatars ( the characters are deliberately unnamed ) , at once greater and lesser in status . < br / > < br / > the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic ; here , dimaggio ' s net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card . monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress , hair , lipstick , wiggle and voice . by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles , the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity , exploding the cult of personality . < br / > < br / > furthering the theme , there will be another explosion at the film ' s climax : hiroshima in a hotel suite , in which ' the actress ' is burned to a cinder in seconds ; a literal deconstruction of fame . goodbye , norma jean . history informs the script , which in turn , shakes history upside down . as roeg mused after watching johnson ' s play for the first time , " these characters were mythic , not invented by any single person , not the public or the press , probably not even by the characters themselves . " as played by theresa russell , marilyn ( a closet intellectual in real life ) , lectures a childlike einstein ( ' the professor ' , played by emil ) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight , while getting the professor to show off his legs , in conscious parody of her own role in the seven - year itch , the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the film ' s opening . < br / > < br / > history records that monroe ' s then - husband , fading baseball star dimaggio ( played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton ) , was unhappy about her iconic dress - splaying scene in the film , precipitating their break - up . right on cue , we discover the jealous ' ballplayer ' in a bar , bemoaning the fact that if , " i want to see her underwear , i just walk down to the corner like all the other guys " . < br / > < br / > in contrast to the professor , the ballplayer believes the universe is round - a contention shared by native americans . but the big chief ( sampson , of one flew over the cuckoo ' s nest fame ) who operates the roosevelt hotel ' s elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture : " i no longer cherokee - i watch tv . " meanwhile , ' the senator ' is investigating the professor , who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations , but whom the senator suspects is a red . in fact , as he divulges to monroe , einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima , and what the white heat future holds . yet in a seemingly godless universe , all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher ( atomic ) power . < br / > < br / > roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnson ' s stage play to the screen . throughout , tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash - forwards ( ka - boom ! ) draw unexpected connections between time , place and circumstance , with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time ' s passing - but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time ; each moment co - existing . as evinced by his back catalogue , it ' s something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity - see don ' t look now in particular . here , 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip - feeds into the 1980s , a period in which another ' actor ' has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united states . < br / > < br / > if all this sounds rather heavy going ( quantum physics is surely involved ) , the execution is anything but , owing to johnson ' s witty , zippy screenplay , roeg ' s playful direction , opening out an essentially stagey set - up - and the cast themselves , who are on stellar form . tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid , impotent senator , who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator ( a real one , as opposed to russell ' s ) , before being let down by his dwindling member . < br / > < br / > of course , curtis once co - starred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot , and whose embrace he memorably described as like " kissing hitler " . as roeg commented , " everything suddenly seemed connected . . . when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking . " it all goes into the pot , to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways . 
POS nina foch insists that " my name is julia ross " in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready . it ' s short , and because it is , the film suffers . it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer . < br / > < br / > when i was growing up , foch was a fixture on television , playing a neurotic woman , the wife with the cheating husband , the nervous wreck . she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles . here , she ' s a pretty young ingenue playing the title role . julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs . hughes and her son ralph . little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front , set up to get just the right woman for this assignment , a woman with no family and no boyfriend . < br / > < br / > it ' s a live - in situation ; once julia gets to the house , she ' s drugged , and when she wakes up , she ' s told she ' s mrs . hughes and not allowed to leave . < br / > < br / > the acting is very good . low budget but still entertaining - some things , particularly at the end , happen way too quickly , which is why i said the movie is too short . nevertheless , i recommend it . 
POS greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman , nina foch , ( julia ross ) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work . julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs . hughes , ( dame may witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . george macready , ( ralph hughes ) is the son of mrs . hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense . 
POS for those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls , think again . there is a totally different side to the japanese animation . yakitate ! japan is one of those shows . it is a sweet - natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread . his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european breads . the show is as wacky as they come and i ' m sure that non - japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes . but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show . < br / > < br / > in the world of yakitate ! it is not uncommon for people to look like they ' ve just had an orgasm after eating bread . the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers , from time - traveling to swimming like a fish . that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i ' ve watched in a while . 
POS . . . that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version . < br / > < br / > despite all of the other comments written here , i really prefer the bette davis version , even though the novak version has a more coherent story line . < br / > < br / > however : davis ' mildred ' s raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute . < br / > < br / > and it is those raw emotions that constitute * part * of what the poor doctor falls in love with . he has emotions of despair , of failure , of " otherness " - strong emotions that he represses . davis ' mildred , on the other hand , displays her emotions immediately and without censure . she has no feelings of despair , or of failure , or of " otherness " ; rather , she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era . < br / > < br / > novak ' s portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis ' , almost through the the whole movie . davis ' mildred was * * never * * vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance . and when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together , and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen : " i wiped my mouth ! i wiped my mouth ! ! " novak ' s vulnerability was excellent . davis ' realism was monumental . < br / > < br / > imdb votes concur !

POS as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark . i always sat down and watched the first one . as i got older i learned to prefer this one . what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants , but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more , it doesn ' t seem as dark as it was back when you were a child . < br / > < br / > this movie , in my opinion , is better than the first one , everything is so much deeper . it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one . the cubs are just too adorable , i rewind that ' flying my colors ' scene . i tend to annoy everyone by singing it . < br / > < br / > the sound track is great ! a big hand to carol and dean parks . i love every song in this movie , i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to , i ' m listening to ' our beginning ' also known as ' recalling ' at the moment . i have always preferred this sound track to the first one , although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie ' care - a - lot ' . < br / > < br / > i think the animation is great , the animation in both movies are fantastic . i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent . it was really surprising . < br / > < br / > there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great , but it is . i do not think it is weird / strange . i think it is a wonderful movie . < br / > < br / > basically , this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon , dark heart . the end is surprising and again , beats any ' pokemon movie ' with the care bears moral issues . it leaves an effect on you . again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality . 
POS in a year of pretentious muck like " synecdoche , new york " a film born out of charlie kaufman ' s own self - indulgence , comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important . " frownland " is a labor of love by the crew , the actors and the filmmaker , shot over years by friends . it traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic , real brooklyn world . the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the " mumblecore " movement . they are real people , painfully trapped in their own self - contained neuroses , unwilling to change , unable . the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch , it is very difficult to watch . it is 16mm film - making without proper light , money or any of the other factors that would make a film " slick " , but its honesty can not be understated , a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw . this does remind of films like " naked " or the best of the " mumblecore " . it is a film that is not for everyone , but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it . 
POS i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea . i think the " dark - heart " character is a little on the rough side and i don ' t like the way he shape - shifts into a " mean " frog , fox , boy i was wrong , this movie was made for my kid , not for me . she " gets it " when it went over ( under ? ) my head . of course i don ' t " get it " . this isn ' t one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy . this is straight for the young ones , and the crew knew what they were doing . there isn ' t any political junk ether . there ' s no magic key that will save the world from ourselves , nobody has the right to access excess , and everyone isn ' t happy all the time . and as a side benefit , nobody dies !  russwill .

POS in nyc , seaman michael o ' hara ( orson welles ) rescues elsa bannister ( rita hayworth ) from a mugging & rape as she takes a horse & carriage through central park - and lives to regret it . titian - haired hayworth ' s a platinum blonde in this one ; as dazzling as fresh - fallen snow - but nowhere near as pure . . . < br / > < br / > to reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal " noir " would be criminal . it ' s as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes - but the film holds far darker secrets : from the ny times : " childhood shadows : the hidden story of the black dahlia murder " by mary pacios " mary pacios , who was 5 years old when she was befriended by 15 year old bette short , retraces short ' s steps , interviewing friends and associates . she also offered a detailed , if speculative , analysis of orson welles - particularly in regard to his movie " the lady from shanghai " . according to ms . pacios , the movie , along with related archival materials , has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with short ' s murder . she raises the question : could welles have been the killer ? " interesting theories - and with the spate of books now out on " the black dahlia " , much more may come to light . fritz lang ' s brutal " film noir " , " the big heat " ( 1953 ) , was a roman - a - clef telling of the " dahlia " killing in " the city of nets " that was l . a . - but it ' s the orson opus that the " dahlia " had a " hands - on " connection to . in reality , it was bugsy siegel ( and the hollywood mob wars of the 1940 ' s ) that did the " dahlia " in . . . but that doesn ' t negate much of what pacios wrote . almost all of hollywood intersected with elizabeth ( " the black dahlia " ) short and her tale / aura / legacy / curse is encoded in a number of golden age films . < br / > < br / > the " black dahlia " was always on the peripheral edges of " shanghai " - even before it started filming . barbara payton on franchot tone : " it was when he was thinking about making " the lady from shanghai " , before he lost the option to orson welles . franchot said he ' d been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the dahlia in the formosa cafe * across from the goldwyn studios . . . " * the floor above the formosa cafe was bugsy siegel ' s office and " the dahlia " one of his on again / off again working " girls " . < br / > < br / > it gets deeper and darker - after the 1951 brawl over barbara payton between tom neal and franchot tone that sent franchot to the hospital with a concussion and " never talking the same way again , " barbara said , she married tone " just to spite neal . " tom ( " detour " ) neal also knew " the dahlia " ( who didn ' t ? ) and became obsessed - from " l . a . despair " by john gilmore : " the january 1947 slaying of the young , beautiful would - be actress elizabeth short , known as " the black dahlia " , was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime . a project , called " who killed the black dahlia ? " was being kicked off by actor tom neal , a hell - raiser from ww ii movies . potential producer gene harris : " someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by tom neal and his cohorts . . . " not long after : " it would be very clear one beautiful day to come , when tom would sneak up on his pretty , new palm springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a . 45 bullet through her head . " barbara payton and norma jean dougherty ( later marilyn monroe ) knew the " dahlia " and their stories are well known . it seems all who crossed the path of the " dahlia " ( like the proverbial black cat ) entered a " twilight zone " darkness and / or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward . tone / neal / welles are only a few - and this includes a butchered film called " the lady from shanghai " . . . < br / > < br / > " lady from shanghai " took two years to be released , thanks to extensive re - editing - and all because columbia president harry cohn couldn ' t understand the story . it ' s dark " noir " to be sure - one of the darkest , in fact . it ' s also a wicked satire on life in the new atomic age . < br / > < br / > nicolas christopher : < br / > < br / > " shanghai " pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the american city . the film ' s principal murder victim ( and there are many ) , a psychotic and double - dealing lawyer , manically foresees armageddon at every turn , claiming he can " feel it . " he announces that he plans to escape to a remote pacific island - a particularly acid joke on welles ' part since this was the very year the u . s . began testing atomic bombs at just such a place , the bikini atoll , relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem . by the time of bikini , the erotic identification of hayworth with the bomb appears to have been institutionalized , with the blessing of the military brass ; the first bomb dropped in the pacific testing ground in named " gilda " and has hayworth ' s image , in provocative dress , painted directly on its casing . . . " < br / > < br / > its ironic that orson welles ' broad interpretation of an irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many . welles is giving a clue to viewers that " michael o ' hara " is only the storyteller - not part of the story even though it revolves around him . " o ' hara " contradicts the shark motif throughout the film . sharks on a feeding frenzy won ' t stop until there ' s nothing left . " michael o ' hara " lives to tell the tale . " elsa bannister " causes a feeding frenzy during " o ' hara ' s " trial and her netted chapeau suggests she ' s caged in - so as not to devour the human spectators to a roman coleseum . the spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own , gossiping and carrying on about " elsa " - a human aquarium correlating to the san francisco marine museum sequence . that ' s the human condition . . . except for " michael o ' hara " . and yet he ' ll be spending his life trying to forget his past ( " elsa " ) - or die trying . " elsa " is part of " michael " and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble . 
POS as i watched one of orson welles ' last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker , i knew i was watching a great movie unfold , though at times i did not know why . the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film - noir : average - joe lead , femme fatale , conspicuous supporting characters , and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure . it is an entertaining ride , and it ' s filled to the brim with welles ' unique gifts as a director , but there are scenes that tend to just not work , or don ' t feel complete in what was welles ' full vision ( the latter is unfortunately too true - executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that ) . < br / > < br / > welles co - stars with his then wife , the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth , as mike o ' hara , an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people . hayworth is mrs . bannister , married to mr . bannister ( everett sloane , who played mr . bernstein in citizen kane ) , who is accompanied by a friend mr . grisby ( glenn anders , who has great control in his eyes ) . they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o ' hara along for the ride , and at first he ' s reluctant , but agrees since he ' s falling for the married mrs . as their journey unfolds , o ' hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around , and more so with grisby , who at first seems out of his gourd . yet as the plot unfolds , o ' hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money , with results that i dare not reveal ( although they have been discussed over and over by others ) . < br / > < br / > whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story ( and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated ) , the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty - five years . though he doesn ' t have the terrific greg tolland ( kane ' s dp ) at his side , dependable charles lawton jr . assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark , covered in shadows , deep focus , low angles , the works . a particular accomplishment is the fun - house mirror scene , which is merely a highlight among others . welles himself is always dependable as an actor - even if his accent isn ' t anything special - and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush , despite her path in the story . < br / > < br / > the lady from shanghai is worth checking out , especially for welles , hayworth , or film - noir buffs ( fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well ) . it may just take a little while , repeat viewings ( as was for touch of evil ) , for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in . 
POS set in japan , ashura is the story of demons taking over the earth . the premise is far more complicated , but the arching storyline should not be forgotten . japan is in turmoil , with demons occupying human form roaming the lands . generally speaking demons look and act like humans , but are evil . the japanese word they use is not just demons , but rather the classical form of ' ogre ' which is a mythological creature of some historic stature . we ' re talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child - eating monsters . < br / > < br / > however in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth , which appear when put under any sort of stress . in order to save the world from demons there are demon - slayers . trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon , and who guard the passage - way between the realm of hell and that of the real world . these are the basic premises . < br / > < br / > the story begins with a festival in a local town . amid these festivities , 3 men ride in , dressed in all black , seemingly intent on doing harm . the villagers run , excepting those which are demonic in nature , who turn green - eyed and try to kill them . the demon - slayers end up killing off the majority of the demons . from here the story gets interesting . the whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune - telling demon appears before the 3 gate - keepers , revealing the arrival of ashura . with it , comes the end of the reign of man , and begins the reign of demons . ashura however requires some form of birthing process , the first step of which occurred during the opening battle , but which won ' t be revealed to you until you see the film . the 3 demon - slayers are a wise old man , a powerful yet unprincipled man , and a skilled and compassionate warrior . immediately you can see the split between them , the old man wanting to stop the demons , the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second . along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to , and believes himself to have a special relationship with . she in turn is a brigand who is good - natured , sought after by authorities . when the two finally meet face to face , he places his hand on her shoulder , and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder . needless to say , the mark is not a good sign . what ensues is a battle for earth , a battle between both good and evil , as it should be , but also between good and good itself . < br / > < br / > the point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would . i came in thinking it would either be a fast - paced action style film with demons , or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in ringu and ju - on . i was however mistaken in the best possible way . the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play , and it plays itself out as such , combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept , an amazing narrative , and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore . many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a hollywood film . it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away . < br / > < br / > the film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camera - work comparable to many great samurai films of our days , but adding to it a well - thought and classical plot . with great acting , great music , and thoroughly stunning scenes , its a must watch in my book . < br / > < br / > that being said , it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone . its not cheap thrills horror , its not balls to the wall action . its a horror style play thats been filmed . it has very much to say and takes the time to do so , flying in the face of the conventional one - liners . like japanese plays , the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene . if you can enjoy such a thing , this is a masterpiece . if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity , then you can easily watch something else . < br / > < br / > overall , this film to me is a unique and amazing one , which keeps you riveted and amused . it has good writing , good acting , and good direction . it is all in all a solidly great film . 
POS this is a nice piece of work . very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout . its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made - for - tv : full screen , and though there were several sex scenes , there was absolutely no nudity ( but boy did it come close ! ) . strange , too , since netflix shows that it was rated r . < br / > < br / > nonetheless , very titillating , and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like this . < br / > < br / > one netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series , but i have been unable to find out what series that is . i ' d like to find out , though , because this movie was that good . < br / > < br / > walt d in lv . 8 / 23 / 2005 
POS i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me . to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot . hahahaha . . . but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death " i was inside you " . i think that ' s what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she ' s too young when he never cared how old the other girls were . ? now i don ' t think i myself could ever trust a cop like that . but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way . and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store . hahahahaha . she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello ! ! it ' s called back - up . sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things . but that ' s what i think an thought about the movie .

" this movie you ' ve popped in . . . isn ' t a normal movie . you ' ve just taken your first step into the incredible melting man , the famous late - 70 ' s gore film featuring rick baker ' s wonderful makeup effects . baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar , and did this at the same time as his famous " cantina aliens " in star wars . for some strange reason , star wars became a household name , and incredible melting man did not . < br / > < br / > it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind - numbingly awful . from the opening credits ( " starring alex rebar as the incredible melting man " . . . that ' s really what it says ! ) , to the chubby nurse running through a glass door , to the fisherman ' s head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks , this film provides many , many moments of sheer incomprehensibility . " why did they . . . but how come he . . . why are they . . . ? " after a while , you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is - - a very entertaining piece of garbage . < br / > < br / > an astronaut returns to earth in a melting , radioactive condition ; he escapes and , his mind disintegrating as well as his body , begins a mad melting killing spree . the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped , but ( probably not wanting to " cause a panic " ) want him captured as quietly as possible . so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him . wow . < br / > < br / > storywise , surprisingly little happens during the movie . the melting guy wanders around killing people . a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter . various characters are introduced , ask questions , and leave . eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man , but is shot by a security guard for no reason , after he explains that he ' s " dr . ted nelson . " the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo . the end . < br / > < br / > it ' s so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun , despite a fairly downbeat ending . supposedly , a widescreen dvd release is planned . a very special movie . 
POS thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo , can ' t stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena , and even that granola over there doesn ' t look so innocent anymore ! why wasn ' t the song " slop time " , by the sherrys , used as the theme ? 
POS about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors . i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn ' t try to find it anywhere . then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought " hey why not " and tried finding it on the internet . eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films . i called my dad over to the computer and said to him " hey dad i ' ve found that creepy film you told me about ages ago ! " he smiled at me , turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it . i started off fine . . . then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving . at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up . . . it made me jump ! : p if you haven ' t seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it . even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling . < br / > < br / > great film ! 
POS excellent farce ! which , of course , is all it is intended to be . thankfully there is neither a social or political message , nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction . could the plot actually take , or have taken place in any particular time or location ? unlikely , for , after all , this is simply , merely , a movie , and movies spring from imagination , not from reality . the only goal of this movie is to entertain , certainly not to educate , and entertain it does , with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds . i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity . but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a " no - brainer , " which the mating game is in all respects . for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then , this is fine fare fantasy . 
POS as winter approaches , our state - owned broadcaster , the abc , has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights . this commenced with a twelve - year old movie length version of " emma " last sunday ; more recent versions of three other novels , " persuasion " , " northanger abbey " and " mansfield park " are to come . < br / > < br / > the curious thing about this production by a & e television networks , with script by the ever - reliable andrew davies , is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions , one starring gwyneth paltrow , and " clueless " , a " modernized " version , starring alicia silverstone , which transported the plot to beverly hills . perhaps as a result , even with kate beckinsale in the lead , this production sank without trace . < br / > < br / > as a general rule , much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length . the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters . an outstanding example is " brideshead revisited " which had 13 50 - minute episodes back in 1982 . you only have to compare the very ordinary movie - length version of " pride and prejudice " in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six - part tv mini - series . it ' s not that a novel should be filmed page by page , and some novels ( often not very good ones ) adapt wonderfully to film ( " atonement " is a recent example ) , but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm . < br / > < br / > given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation , this production is ok . kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self - assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly ( he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters  knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p & p ) . samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly  sybil fawlty on speed . bernard hepton as emma ' s feeble father was also excellent . we saw the damp countryside , the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors , in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody . < br / > < br / > even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted , even allowing for the formalities of the times . i ' d have to look at the film again to be sure , but it might be due to the under - use of reaction shots . < br / > < br / > if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example , and compares well with the paltrow version . anyway , there is more to come ! 
POS they filmed this movie out on long island , where i grew up . my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie . apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer , ( which they told me was colored water , tasted disgusting , and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again , especially in the funnel scenes ) . yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form . it never came out in the theaters ( obviously ) and it , as far as i knew , was never released on video , and i ' m sure wasn ' t released on dvd . yet it looks like it was seen by some people , albeit it probably very few . so there must be something . i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother , yet there is no way i can find it anywhere . does anybody know anything about when / where / how this movie could be purchased ? and which format that would be ? 
POS i never heard of the book , nor care to read it , but the movie i will probably see many times . < br / > < br / > this film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie . it was as if i was looking at paintings many times , which i think was the idea . < br / > < br / > terrific movie , story , actors , and cinematography . full of profound emotions from every angle . although i am not particularly fond of romance movies , i loved this and was deeply moved by winona ryder ' s plea to her father toward the end . < br / > < br / > mr . irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never better . < br / > < br / > 
POS this movie is an incredible piece of work . it explores every nook and cranny of the human mind , focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them . stellar performances all around . this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight . spend some real time with this one . 
POS this 1991 nbc - tv movie aired six months before john goodman ' s big - screen version of the life of babe ruth came out . for my money , there is no comparison between the two . the tv production isn ' t perfect but it presents the babe ' s story with more depth and complexity than goodman ' s one - dimensional telling . i especially enjoyed the film ' s depiction of the complex love - hate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins , who always understood his star player ' s brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruth ' s own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players . the tv - movie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws , while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking . < br / > < br / > this film makes a great companion piece to " eight men out " since the story starts with ruth ' s arrival in new york in 1920 , one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin . indeed , the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his " eight men out " role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis . 
POS master director ching siu tung ' s perhaps most popular achievement is this series , a chinese ghost story 1 - 3 . chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his " collecting trip " in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him . beautiful actress joey wang / wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon , a wood devil who collects human souls for herself / itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts . leslie and joey fall in love , and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans , they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives . this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness . < br / > < br / > this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung . his masterpieces include duel to the death ( 1983 ) and the swordsman series , which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes . ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere , which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost . the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen . the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has . there ' s plenty of wire ' fu stunts , too , and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films , i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic , freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give . when people fly in these films , it means the films are not just about our world , and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form . < br / > < br / > the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm , but the problem is ( again ) that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally . leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm , deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement . also , the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer ' s mind to be interpreted and found . another negative point about the dialogue is that it ' s too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason . that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies . people just talk and talk and it ' s all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element . just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano ; his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks , or makes other characters talk too much in his movies . this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts . < br / > < br / > otherwise , chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema , and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then . i give chinese ghost story 7 / 10 and without the flaws mentioned above , this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre . 
POS first things first , the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed . now actress wang zu xian , the one who played xiao qian in the movie , is 42 years old and well aged . it ' s always good to review these glorious times when seeing old - school hongkong productions like this . < br / > < br / > the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s . the art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing . more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it . it feels like a horror movie but ultimately it ' s not scaring , but only fun . < br / > < br / > i had the experience of translating the second script of " a chinese ghotst story " , and i thought that script was a decent write . however when i saw the movie , i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script , like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles . however , it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining . < br / > < br / > if you have seen the lord of the rings , you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr . the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch . it ' s definitely a laugh - out - loud . bravo ! 
POS kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama , and the acting is true to the story , with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale . it is touching , funny and intriguing in all parts . the character development is near perfect , the cinematography is vivid and engaging , and the story draws you in . < br / > < br / > i would like to say that the " samurai freaks " and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa ' s best work . perhaps not his best , but even at his worst , kurosawa is better than many of the best . this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change , that it is timeless , despite being set in the not - so - distant past . < br / > < br / > i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff , and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based . 
POS michael winner is probably best known for his revenge - themed films , such as " death wish " and " chato ' s land " , but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema , as " the sentinel " of 1977 proves . " the sentinel " , which is based on a novel by john konvitz , who also wrote the screenplay , is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult horror should consider missing . the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as " rosemary ' s baby " , " the exorcist " or " the omen " , but , as far as i am concerned , it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films , and probably even creepier . < br / > < br / > allison parker ( christina raines ) is a beautiful young new york model . traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend ( chris sarandon ) , allison is in search for an apartment , and finds a big , incredibly nice one , which is also affordable , in an old mansion in brooklyn . the new apartment , however , comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants . and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to alice . . . this may not be an adequate plot synopsis , but i would hate to spoil any of this film ' s great moments , so i will not give any further plot description . what i will say , however , is that " the sentinel " is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere . the fact that director michael winner and writer john konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome . the film is imaginatively photographed , and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film . as mentioned above , the atmosphere is obscure and creepy , and the film also includes several shock - moments and genuine scares . the film features many sinister and eccentric characters , and the cast is superb . beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker , lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind . chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend , a successful lawyer , and the supporting cast includes many big names , such as christopher walken , jeff goldblum , jerry orbach , beverly d ' angelo and tom berenger , before becoming really famous . the cast also includes stars like ava gardner , horror icon john carradine , burgess meredith , and , my personal favorite , the great eli wallach as a cynical homicide detective . i ' ve been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time , mostly for films like " death wish " and " chato ' s land " . " the sentinel " is yet another great film in winner ' s repertoire , and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard - boiled revenge - cinema , but also of atmospheric occult horror . all in all , " the sentinel " is a creepy , intelligent , and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all horror fans ! 
POS this was a highly original decent movie , and a brave move for all those involved . i don ' t care if it ' s not the most well put - together movie of all time , the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non - formulaic , and that i don ' t know what will happen next , makes it a favorite of mine . i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one , rather than the same old formula for entertainment . 
POS of all the movies of the seventies , none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel . i mean , yes , there were movies like the exorcist , and other ones ; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one . if you have time , check this one out . you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such , but this is a story worth getting into . then there are all the stars and soon - to - be stars . my absolute favorites were eli wallach , sylvia miles , and burgess meredith . then there are the subtle clues that lead to what ' s going on too . pay close attention . i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like ' black and white cat , black and white cake ' . plus , the books are really good as well . i ' m just sorry that they ' re not going to turn the second book into a film . it ' s so scary that it would outdo this movie . 
POS i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection - many unseen - and picked out a movie , based on the box art , i thought would be fun , and yes , bad . prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box . i sat down and watched , and lo ! and behold ! , found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind . fortunately , i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total . prison tells the story of an old , dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns . it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners . the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film . the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair . we see lane smith as a guard - tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker . we then go to present day , first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re - opening the old prison . then we see the new warden , lane smith , haunted by a nightmare in bed - and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years . well , the rest follows suit : prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding . we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters . the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job . viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid . tom everett , tiny lister , and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters . chelsea field is okay as the female lead . the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick , an underrated character actor , as cresus - a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the " man " had been executed " with some kind of terrible secret . prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that , but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it . i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric . the film has a tense , taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes . there are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes . but these scenes are visually creative and interesting . the acting is uniformly decent . the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these . that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story . you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday . here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is . give prison a break ( get it ) . 
POS david duchovny plays the lead role in this film . now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn ' t even bother watching it . very unfair to say the least . david made his name on the x - files and is a decent actor . dr eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice . by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom . however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom . angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare - the gangsters moll . she puts in a solid performance . timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character . duchovny himself isn ' t as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible . his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen ' t detract too much from the film 
POS i just saw this movie on tv . . < br / > < br / > i ' ve lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me . . < br / > < br / > i can feel the lost that the little girl desi felt . . < br / > < br / > the feeling of wanting to see her father again . . < br / > < br / > wanting to talk to him . . < br / > < br / > or at least given the chance to say goodbye . . < br / > < br / > and i ' m so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her . . < br / > < br / > saying that her father read her letter , and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn ' t a shop in heaven . . < br / > < br / > it just lets me feel that miracles do exist . . 
POS following their daughter ' s brutal murder , julie and allen escape the city to find solace and grieve in a solitary cabin on a remote mountain . allen ' s intentions are good , he wants his wife to get out of her depression by resuming her photography . julie stumbles across an ancient prison and sees the perfect creepy , decaying setting for her photography . but when the photos are developed they are full of dead people - and allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain . " dark remains " is a pretty decent indie horror flick . it offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension . the acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great . 7 out of 10 . 
POS this might contain a spoiler , so beware . < br / > < br / > if it had been 200 , 000 thousand or two million people , does it make a difference ? sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of ( strangely very loud ) americans , but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone . god help us for what we have done . after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans , and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race , you would think we ' d have grown hearts and souls in the late 60 ' s and early 70 ' s . but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us . how then , can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will ? we are contradictory and hypocritical , and i am ashamed for this . i feel sorrow for the people affected . they deserve justice and their homes back . if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety , i don ' t want it . i denounce these actions , and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit . no one is above the law . i want my country back , and so do the chagos islanders . regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers , no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports . we can ' t stand to be stuck in traffic , let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes . ' not one of us , brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around . don ' t buy into the fallacy that a simpler , more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed , and preserved - when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000 , we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men . 
POS to fight against the death penalty is a just cause . everyone who is sane in europe would think so . in the usa everything is different . the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice . a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case . but the film has a sequel . justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance . miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance . one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges . this public attorney ' s officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free . but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire . he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance . but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls . he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys . one day the local cops follow their intuition , guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl , and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of . they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette . he confesses . sent to death row , he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorney ' s representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails . it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice , police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality , some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance . to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice . the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention , just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence , which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial , hence easily discardable , with a good lawyer . the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don ' t want to make a mistake , which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have : " we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . " ( declaration of independence ) life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator , which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away . only god can take the life of a person away . the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have . even if we do not evoke god , we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance , and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace . if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty . and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance . < br / > < br / > dr jacques coulardeau , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne , university paris 8 saint denis , university paris 12 créteil , cegid 
POS a compelling thriller ! ! , 10 december 2005 author : littlehammer16787 from united states < br / > < br / > just cause < br / > < br / > starring : sean connery , laurence fishburne , and blair underwood . < br / > < br / > a liberal , though good - hearted harvard law professor paul armstrong is convoked to the flordia everglades by unjustly convicted black guy bobby earl . confessing that sadistic , cold - hearted cops vilifyied and beat him to a pulp to get the confession of a gruesome murder of an eleven year old girl . as he digs further and further into the mysterious case he realizes that bobby earl is a victim of discrimination . that the black police detective lt . tanny brown of the small community is corrupt and villainously mean . when the infamous , psychotic serial killer blair sullivan is introduced . he discovers that he knows the location of the murder weapon that butchered the little girl . when armstrong finds that there are lucid coincidences of sullivan ' s road trip through the small town and the letter he personally wrote . bobby earl gets a re - trial . is unfettered from prison and eludes his horrific punishment . all seems swimmingly well until an unexpected phone call from serial killer sullivan comes into focus . armstrong discovers a lurid double killing which happens to be sullivan ' s parents . whom he immensely detests . sullivan divulges to armstrong the truth of joanie shriver ' s heinous murder and why he was brought here . it turns out that bobby earl is a psychopathic murderer and he really did rape and kill joanie shriver . he just merely struck a bargain with fiendish psycho sullivan . to get loose so he could kill again for revenge . upon armstrong ' s beautiful wife and daughter . now sullivan is executed to his death . armstrong and tough good guy brown chase the malevolent villain to the everglades in order to thwart him . when they arrive armstrong learns that the psychotic sicko bobby earl plans to kill his wife and daughter for a former rape trial that inevitably made him endure agonizing pain and castration . but good , virtuous cop brown emerges and thwarts the brutal baddie . is stabbed and eaten by ruthless , man - eating alligators . paul armstrong , tanny brown , his wife , and daughter survive and live happily ever after . a good thriller that works . delivers both mystery and subterfuge . how reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen . sentenced to unfair penalties . even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent , friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie . sean connery is great as the oblivious , holier than thou hero . laurence fishburne is watchably amazing as the mean , arrogant , but good guy cop . underwood and harris are over the top and invigorating as the malevolent psychos . capeshaw is okay . ruby dee is great as the tenacious grandmother . the rest of the cast is wonderful as well . 
POS i found this movie to be charming . i thought the characters were developed since as i watched , i found myself caring about these people . this is a period piece that i believe took place during the depression . a single mother , who is known as the town recluse ( she has reason to be ) , puts an ad in the paper for " a husband " . christopher reeve plays a ex - con who happens into town looking for work . he sees the ad and he goes out to see her . she hires him . i really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because i found it easy to put myself in their shoes . everything went on so matter of fact . he needs the work so he doesn ' t want to upset her . and she needing his help , but doesn ' t want him to get the upper hand . they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other . things start warming up until . . . . . . the big blowup . i won ' t spoil it by telling you what happens . but the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful . i found the story to be very believable for the time it ' s taking place . i think this is one of the better " relationship " stories out there . maybe the younger generation won ' t " get it " but if you are over 40 i think you ' ll like it . and if you liked christopher reeve in " somewhere in time " you ' ll like him in this one also . 
POS this film is a great fun . i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends . i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world ! i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time . but they all thanked me and loved the movie . you know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie ! < br / > < br / > i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri ' s level , but no where near the same size ring . he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old berkeley ca a . a . group where everyone trusts everyone else . he would " sponsor " only people who seemed very well to do . who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k ( in 1987 when that was real money ) after being in town for only 1 month . his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober . he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face . < br / > < br / > the above crime is nothing compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor . but i don ' t want to give anything away . < br / > < br / > i just found this one night on a late night movie channel , " showtim " i think . this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown . just drag your friends over to see this and don ' t tell them a thing . it is a very entertaining film , it moves quickly and never bores you . < br / > < br / > this should be a international classic for all time . i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top . time will be very good to this film . i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet , in some ways that makes the surprises even better . < br / > < br / > the director and editor were fantastic . they deserved winning the best documentary . < br / > < br / > just watch this film ! 
POS this documentary was interesting , but it was also long ( so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes ) , like ben - hur long . but if your into that , this is for you . but only if you have a passion for movies , like i do . being that martin scorsese is my favorite director ( live and maybe even ever ) , this is quite fascinating , especially if you know the style of scorsese ' s works . because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films . not the best documentary film ever made , but it is a leap for scorsese , which is always good to watch . a 
POS thank the lord for martin scorsese , and his love of the movies . < br / > < br / > this is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented american artist working in cinema today , and i couldn ' t recommend it more . i was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too . just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world , you ' ll love it . 
POS this movie is brilliant . the comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn ' t get it . the movie is campy - yes ! but it is uplifting and fun . this movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to absolutely fabulous . it is a must see ! 
POS i loved this movie , and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it , or so it seems . no , this movie is not deep - - who cares ? these kinds of movies never are . but strangely , there is a message in it . it ' s that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to be . < br / > < br / > parker posey is great in this movie . i ' ve always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to katharine hepburn . so , it ' s great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about librarians ( hepburn ' s is the desk set ) . all librarians , especially those with a sense of humor , should see party girl . < br / > < br / > i gave this movie an 8 . it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards , although there are some nice shots in it . but it is incredibly charming and entertaining . 
POS this film is a delightful , light hearted look at both sides of where the " club kid " rave scene blends with the new york art , music and performance art worlds ( with a cameo by the omnipresent miss bunny ) . this is " torch song trilogy " for the perky - post - teen girls . " that girl " for our disaffected , affected millennium times . < br / > < br / > the dialogue is fast and funny , and parker posey ' s costumer deserves - if not an academy award , at least - a stadium " wave " of kudos . < br / > < br / > of course , this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey , and she is perfectly cast . like a lot of her acting work , it may not be very deep , it is often self - referential and , well , posey . . . but it all works . she is a talented comedienne , an incredible entertainer , and this film entertains , she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap , and never lets it drop to the floor . < br / > < br / > mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn ' t above stealing designer clothing from a friend ' s closet or making out with someone else ' s boyfriend . on a deeper level , this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care - less in every sense of the word , including about other people ; and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life . < br / > < br / > the script is beautifully crafted , witty , and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt , in a role that was much too one - dimensional and heavy handed ; a more nuanced performance from her , would have deepened the relationship between the two . . . but . . . hey . . . this is comedy . a surprisingly deep role , that gives this film some substance and world vision , is the fallafel selling boyfriend . we should all be so lucky . . . is he the one for mary ? or the one that gets away ? < br / > < br / > i rate this as a 8 because it isn ' t a great moment of film history , it is not a classic , and it is not great art ( all of which get deeper and richer on re - viewing ) . like " desperately seeking susan " it represents something very true about it ' s time period , but may become irrelevant with time . still , it has everything an entertaining film needs , and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone ! 
POS " party girl " capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey . in fact , at times , the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms . posey is allow to play herself , as she normally is in real life . < br / > < br / > the film , directed by daisy von scherler mayer , is a treat for ms . posey ' s fans . ms . von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents . this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became . at least , there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way , if we can call it that way . < br / > < br / > parker posey makes an amazing mary . it ' s because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary . she is the whole picture . the rest of the cast is good . 
POS a french film ester williams would love . but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves . no question where sciamma ' s sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as " animaux " but actually only the 3 girls are in focus , and for the entire time , with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background . marie is a stick of a girl , unattractive , but determined . she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane ( a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer ) and she is also a friend of convenience to anna : not unattractive , but for her , the time of her body ' s perfection was short , and now she is an adolescent in a women ' s body . what ensues is a journey to self - realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un - natural : where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth ? while the dénouement was breath taking , with floriane ' s self - absorption beautifully portrayed , as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne , it all seemed abstract , sciamma ' s puppets . 
POS a bit slow ( somehow like a sofia coppola movie ) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls . the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age . the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life . the music is perfect and the acting is amazing . the camera works beautifully also . i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires . i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period . so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities . 
POS if you love cult 70 ' s sci - fi the way i do , or if you like movies such as " repo man " or " buckaroo bonzai " than you ' re going to love this one . it ' s a stream of consciousness 70 ' s sci - fi spectacular , including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now . this movie is pure 70 ' s . put on steve miller ' s " fly like an eagle " or pink floyd ' s " dark side of the moon " and you ' re ready to go ! 
POS normally i don ' t like series at all . they ' re all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast . < br / > < br / > these series however , are well played , the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one , the story will still be catching your mind . < br / > < br / > the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital . 
POS earth ( 2009 ) * * * 1 / 2 big screen adaptation of the bbc / discovery channel series " planet earth " offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw - dropping moments of " how the hell did they get this footage ? ! " while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel ( witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal ! ) and adorable ( the various babies and their ' rents ) . the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its ' god ' s eye views ' and profundity . culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage , the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could ' ve even gone longer ! oh , well , there ' s always the next time ( since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come ) . dirs : alastair fothergill & mark linfield . 
POS first of all , the release date is 2009 , not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film . it should be more properly referred to as : " earth , 2009 " . secondly , allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the " planet earth " tv series of 2006 . < br / > < br / > i have not seen this tv series , but learned here , that this film is the full length version of this 2006 tv series . i judge any film , on it ' s own merits , not by it ' s source . i judge the results , on their own , and the results of " earth , 2009 " are indeed excellent . i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers : that it ' s simply an expanded version of the 2006 tv series " planet earth " . so what ? it doesn ' t really matter . < br / > < br / > as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime , i was astonished and highly impressed by " earth , 2009 " . this is the debut film from the new " disneynature " division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disney ' s pioneering and academy award winning nature documentary films of the 1950 ' s and 1960 ' s . < br / > < br / > cinematography , film editing , music score , sound and narration are all excellent . there have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories . what really sets " earth , 2009 " apart is its ' scope . it literally covers the entire planet , covering all seven continents . < br / > < br / > after my first viewing , it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create . < br / > < br / > three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film . < br / > < br / > " earth , 2009 " convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december , from the north pole to the south pole . < br / > < br / > two special new high - tech cameras were used for this film : one camera has a 360 degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing 1 , 000 frames per second . this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of " earth , 2009 " especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world ' s highest waterfall . there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary . < br / > < br / > via cinematography , music score and narration , there is drama , sadness , humor and great beauty in this documentary . with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker , excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration , i consider " earth , 2009 " as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made . < br / > < br / > five years of hard work , patience , talent and dedication really paid off very well here . this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world . i predict an academy award for best documentary feature , among other awards . truly , an amazing , astonishing , exhilarating and magnificent documentary film . < br / > < br / > very highly recommended 
POS i ' ve heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini - series , " planet earth , " narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough . nevertheless , whether it was screened down here in australia or not , i never caught up with it , and when i happened upon the opportunity to see ' earth ( 2007 ) '  a feature - length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen , i jumped at the chance . the theatre was basically empty ; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me , and it was as though i had , not only the big screen to myself , but , indeed , the entire planet earth . for 90 minutes , i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness , amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film . awesome in its scope , and yet painfully intimate at times , ' earth ' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet , and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction . < br / > < br / > though the film , directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield , obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness , it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda , and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether ; indeed , there is not a human in sight . instead , we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world , to experience the resilience , and also the fragility , of life on earth . i hear that the original mini - series , which ran for eleven episodes , delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems , but i think that , here , the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact : i can ' t remember the last time that i felt so inspired , and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time . by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals , anthropomorphising them to an extent , we are suddenly able to appreciate the " human side " of each species , and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy . < br / > < br / > ' earth ' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes , whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice , or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life - saving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta . the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death , most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator - prey interactions . though occasionally , perhaps to cater towards a younger audience , the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment , i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature , and the raw instinct that fuels these animals ' final , hopeless efforts at survival . there ' s even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt , both in the slow - motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey { the result of a single fateful misstep } , or the majestic mid - air leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion . it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species . < br / > < br / > aside from these main stories , we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world , including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea , and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes . of course , entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone , and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly . by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear , elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles , via some astonishing high - definition time - lapse photography , throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show , and only 90 minutes to show it . consequently , ' earth ' left me thirsting for more , and , fortunately , i now have approximately eleven hours more , as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box - set for " planet earth . " uplifting and tear - jerking , awe - inspiring and heartrending , ' earth ' is a truly magnificent documentary experience , and it might just be my favourite film of 2007 . 
POS this is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple . the movie portrais a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion , infidelity , juggling work and family . < br / > < br / > the so called " culture of death " that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think . < br / > < br / > a must see . i hope it gets distributed as it should . < br / > < br / > congratulations on the cast and director . < br / > < br / > two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me ! 
POS enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture . this wonderful creepy , yet mysterious looking english home , with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it . there are four ( 4 ) tales concerning this house , and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems . you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds , but don ' t let that fool you , there is horror all over the place . peter cushing , " black jack " , ' 80 gives a great performance as one of the person ' s living in the home and even christopher lee , " curse of the crimson altar " , 68 and his little daughter , chloe franks , ( jane reid ) make a wonderful exciting story together , his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books ! if you love creepy , horrible and mysterious films , with lots of surprises , this is the film for you ! ! ! ! 
POS diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now . the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today ' s shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side . the way mark ' s brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking , and if you think you do , you are wrong . < br / > < br / > diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics , not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives . everything from racism and adoption , to terrorists and technology . < br / > < br / > as for it being for old people ? i am 24 ! ! i don ' t think i can be classed as old yet . < br / > < br / > i just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on dvd ( not ntsc ) so that i can watch them all in order . they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit ! 
POS well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war . excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck . the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who ' d probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations . real americans might appreciate the story line and the action . for all the action and intrigue , fraulein doktor compares favo ( u ) rably to jacob ' s ladder .

POS show favorites green arrow ( introduced this season ) , aquaman ( introduced in season 5 ) , " impulse " ( season 4 ) , and cyborg ( season 5 ) all come together , along with clark , to stop one of lex ' s evil plans in this thrilling mid - season episode . < br / > < br / > through his sophisticated technology , green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on . green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry ( aqua ) , bart allen ( impulse ) and victor stone ( cyborg ) to stop lex and destroy these facilities . after recruiting clark to help , the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory . < br / > < br / > this episode is incredible . full of action , humor , and fabulous dialog , it feels more like a movie . it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season . 
POS this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm - chair and mellow for a couple of hours . wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage ( as always ) gently row the plot along . there are no rapids to cross , no dangerous waters , just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best . a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received . 
POS a funny comedy from beginning to end ! there are several hilarious scenes but it ' s also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me . creative story line with a very talented cast . i thoroughly enjoyed it ! 
POS this movie is still an all time favorite . only a pretentious , humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film . this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream ! i think this is cher ' s best work ever and her most believable performance . cher has always been blessed with charisma , good looks , and an enviably thin figure . whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like cher ? cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone . she is one of the most unique artists out there . it ' s funny , because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress ? she is heads above the so - called movie " stars " of today . cher is a real actor on the same level as debra winger , alfre woodard , holly hunter , angela bassett and a few others , in that she never seems to be " acting , " she really becomes the character convincingly . she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie - going public . < br / > < br / > everything about moonstruck is wonderful - the characters , the scenery , the dialog , the food . i never get tired of watching this movie . < br / > < br / > every time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at rose ' s house , i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving . i saw the spaghetti , mushrooms ( i think ) , but i can ' t make out whether they are eating ravioli , ziti ? what is that main course ? it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts ! < br / > < br / > everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another . the grandfather wasn ' t pushed aside and tolerated , he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom . he seemed to be a pretty healthy , independent old codger too . < br / > < br / > loretta ' s mom wasn ' t " just a housewife , " she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife , mother , and home manager should aspire to be . she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn ' t let it define who she was . high powered businessmen aren ' t as comfortable in their skin as rose casterini was . notice the saucy way she said " i didn ' t have kids until after i was 37 . it ain ' t over ' til its over . " you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened . she was charming , quick witted , and very smart . what a great mom ! < br / > < br / > i didn ' t actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know - - it - all who wasn ' t really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think . she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong , but she really didn ' t apply common sense to her own life . she was going to marry a middle - aged mama ' s boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life . she was more conventional than her own mom . she dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored , but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man . she would probably end up making an awesome mom too . < br / > < br / > i could see in the future , a house full of loretta and ronnie ' s loud , screaming happy kids and rose and cosmo enjoying every minute of it . 
POS blonde and blonder has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you ' re being utterly unreasonable . it feels like a late era carry on , when the series was no longer blazing trails , but was still more funny than not , think behind or england and you won ' t be too far off the mark . pamela and denise are bubbly , charming and clearly aware this isn ' t a masterpiece they ' re making , although you can give me it over lots of things i ' m told to like . the supporting cast are energetic , even if some of them aren ' t particularly good ; i can ' t see a couple of duff turns in a movie that ' s already practically forgotten making much difference to anything , so just smile . i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it . 
POS don ' t say i didn ' t warn you , but your gonna laugh . probably enough to hurt your stomach . sure it ' s got some blood splattering , all in good fun though . so , it ' s got no budget , who needs a budget when you got a script like this . < br / > < br / > take the time and check this out . well worth a two hour viewing . if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live . < br / > < br / > 
POS the movie looked like a walk - through for " immoral study " . most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about " now , who drew this penis ? ! " sounded a bit gratuitous . dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful , albeit visually this movie got its moments . i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises . highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while . 
POS i ' m normally a sucker for romantic films which are well - filmed and well - acted out . this is a romantic ( period ) film set in 17th - century italy , but filmed in french with english subtitles . the fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower - paced than films set in the modern day era , so it will bore some . if you can overlook that fact , it is actually a really good film . the scenery , the costumes , and the cinematography are beautiful , and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals , projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot . the story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending . its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real - life characters . in spite of the fact that i was really moved by the main characters and the storyline , i decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie ' s story - that of an sad unfinished love story - was completely fabricated . < br / > < br / > in real life , artemisia was raped by tassi initially , rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed . she continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her . when they were in court , he had * not * admitted guilt of rape out of pity for artemisia ' s torture ( unlike what the movie portrays ) . in reality , he had tried to portray artemisia as a loose , promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges . in the movie , his sister testified in court that tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister - in - law , and tassi ' s character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister - in - law ( although he admits to having had a wife back in florence ) . needless to say , in reality it wasn ' t really like that at all . in fact , far from it . tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife , whom he had begotten from rape . and to add to that , tassi really had sexual relations with his sister - in - law , impregnating her in the process , but all this wasn ' t really mutual as well - again , he had raped his sister - in - law before . < br / > < br / > so now we have a clear picture of the real tassi as a multiple sex offender , what do we make of the film artemisia ' s portrayal of him as a lover ? we take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film . . . that this film was never made to be historically accurate . . . apart from these points just mentioned , there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of artemisia ' s art ( in real - life , she was never really influenced by tassi ' s painting style , and she was actually considered a much better painter than tassi ever was . ) one thing remains true and its the fact that artemisia gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history , and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers , she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman , in 17th century italy . < br / > < br / > enjoy this film for its own sake , for it is a pretty good romantic drama , but take its historical references with a grain of salt . 
POS artimisia was on late last night . at first i didn ' t think i would like it , but seeing i didn ' t feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on , i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia , a virgin , pure and passionate . her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feelings . even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality , i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama ' s . great play , great camerashots , great music and texts . i loved it and i want more of it ! : - ) 
POS channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels , this show was certainly a naughty one . the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show , four - time bafta winning and british comedy award winning ( also twice nominated ) graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this . it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it . they basically had an adult idea which would either gross , humiliate or humour the guest , but some are not for the faint - hearted . they had women playing the recorder with their parts , men using their dicks to play a xylophone , women weeing upwards in the bath , men with or without pants under their kilts , and many more gross but hilarious ideas . this is just for adults , but enjoy it ! it won the bafta twice for best entertainment ( programme or series ) , it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme ( also nominated ) , best comedy talk show , it won an emmy for episode # 18 ( ? ) , and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show . it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments . very good ! 
POS rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre , sergio martino . fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi , this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film . it ' s when everything has fallen into place that we can go , " ahh . . " the film revolves around the death of a husband ( . . in an airplane explosion ) and the million dollars the wife receives from it . there are those with great interest in that money , one in particular being the dead man ' s mistress . the wife is lisa ( ida galli ) and the mistress demanding half the money is lara ( janine reynaud ) . she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money . lara says she ' ll use her " lawyer " , sharif ( luis barboo ) to get that money . so already , the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa , who awaiting someone in tokyo . george hilton portrays peter lynch . peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means . when , on his watch , lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room , he is a possible suspect . he decides to do a little investigating himself , while also assisting inspector stavros ( luigi pistilli ) and interpol agent , benton ( tom felleghy ) on their quest to find a killer . the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa . soon , the film follows a journalist , cléo dupont ( the delicious , luscious anita strindberg ) as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her . soon they fall deeply in love , but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed . soon someone attacks cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory . why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people . < br / > < br / > this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow . the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer . this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken ( the throat and lower torso ) . the film ' s conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying . the film has some unique camera angles , but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery . 
POS la coda dello scorpione ( a . k . a . case of the scorpion ' s tail ) was director sergio martino ' s follow - up to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh . this is the quintessential giallo , featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love . twisty plot , beautiful girls , black gloves , sharp blades , and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation . < br / > < br / > a group of gialli favorites , both in front of and behind the camera , work to make this one of the best non - argento gialli around . there ' s the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director , giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer , bruno nicolai creating the music , and a host of giallo stars and starlets , such as george hilton , character actor luigi pistilli , and the fetching anita strindberg . < br / > < br / > with all this talent behind it , does scorpione deliver ? you bet . the film works on many different levels . it ' s a thrilling murder mystery , a tense and violent horror film , and a suspenseful thriller . all in all one of the best gialli around . < br / > < br / > martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli . at some points in the film , he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach . for example , there is a direct rip - off of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door , that actually outdoes argento ' s flick . < br / > < br / > are there any problems with the flick ? hmmm . . . only minor ones . first , any scenes that aren ' t following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore . but just before you fall asleep , the killer will pop out of nowhere and you ' ll be right back in the swing of things . < br / > < br / > also , towards the end , the twists get a little too bizarre . i mean , what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve ? if you don ' t play close attention to the dialogue , you could easily become lost with the twisting , weaving storyline . < br / > < br / > but these minor quibbles aside , la coda dello scorpione is a tense , suspenseful , classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans . seek it out ! 
POS i ' m really tempted to reward " the case of the scorpion ' s tail " with a solid 10 out of 10 rating , but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970 ' s is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch . but even without an extra point for nostalgia , this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story , uncanny atmosphere , blood - soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices . in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martino ' s finest giallo , and that has got to mean something , as " the strange vice of mrs . wardh " , " all the colors of the dark " , " torso " and " your vice is a locked room and only i have the key " are all top - notch genre achievements as well . but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra - compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control . following her husband ' s peculiar death in a plane explosion ( ! ) , lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she ' s eager to leave the country as soon as possible . due to the bizarre circumstances , the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece . there , lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the case ' s mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money . i ' m always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i don ' t want to risk giving away essential plot elements . in " the case of the scorpion ' s tail " , the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway , and i certainly don ' t want to ruin this for you . many red herrings follow after that , but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and , even though not a 100 % satisfying , the denouement is at least surprising . it ' s also a very stylish film , with imaginative camera - work and excellent music by bruno nicolai . everyone ' s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didn ' t make it to this cast ( she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino gialli ) , but anita strindberg ( " lizard in a woman ' s skin " , " who saw her die ? " ) is a more than worthy replacement for her . the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies ' man deluxe . if you ' re a fan of giallo , don ' t wait as long as i did to watch this film ! ! ! ! 
POS i found this to be a so - so romance / drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it . it ' s not a hallmark hall of fame - type family film with sleeping - before - marriage considered " normal " behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro , i would have expected a lot rougher movie , at least language - wise . < br / > < br / > the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult . that ' s the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but , to be honest , the film isn ' t that memorable . < br / > < br / > it ' s still a fairly mild , nice tale that i would be happy to recommend . 
POS i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty ' blood rites ' . as blood rites was entirely awful , i really wasn ' t expecting much from this film ; but actually , it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation . the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites , as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit , and of course ; there is an inheritance at stake . the film is shot in black and white , and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic ' the curious dr humpp ' . there ' s barely any gore on display , and the director seems keener to focus on sex , with themes of incest and hatred seeping through . the acting is typically trashy , but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation , director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing , as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful . the plot is paper thin , and most of the film is filler ; but the music is catchy , and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves , as most are somewhat erotic . overall , this is not a great film ; but it ' s likely to appeal to the cult fan , and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality ' blood rites ' . 
POS don ' t listen to fuddy - duddy critics on this one , this is a gem ! young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living ! she , naturally , becomes a reporter , and he , just as naturally , a driver for the mob ! by wild co - incidences their careers meet head on , thanks to gangster clark gable . in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers ( with all the grace of a steam - shovel ) . < br / > < br / > but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it ' s all good fun from those wonderful pre - code days , when hollywood was really naughty . joan looks great , and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity ( thank god she stopped the dancing ! ) . gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn ' t a star yet and so didn ' t have to be the hero . great to see him playing something different . and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother . and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont , who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience ! great fun ! 
POS i don ' t know how anyone could hate this movie . it is so funny . it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline . it ' s not your typical alien movie . these aliens are so stupid and confused . you need to rent it at least once . 
POS i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it . her dancing was very entertaining . i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance . the scenery was great too . yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful . we laughed at the silly kissing scenes , but that is what is great about old movies ! i grew up with her on the munsters and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies . they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing . i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them . i have a large collection of her memorabilia . 
POS i ' m not quite sure if the term " serious comedy " applies to this movie , im not even sure if this can be applied . on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin . therefore , i considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as " serious comedies " . < br / > < br / > does the 40 year old virgin fit into this guild ? that is finally up to you , but in my opinion , this is a very funny movie . you get to laugh a lot , plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations . < br / > < br / > i ' m pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there , and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications , may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie , especially men . < br / > < br / > the story , as the title says it , is about andy , a shy , silent guy , whom collects action figures , watches survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is asia . < br / > < br / > kal is andy ' s co - worker at smarttech . he believes andy to be a psychopath until andy ' s secret is revealed . kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre . < br / > < br / > david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex - girlfriend , whom ran away with another guy . and jay , a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts . < br / > < br / > i ' m pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film , but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it . so in case you haven ' t seen it and will enjoy a little laugh , with social commentary , than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films . < br / > < br / > it also includes dvd bonuses which you ' ll really see from top to bottom . 
POS i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn ' t know what to expect . the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make - fun - of - the - virgin humor . what a great surprise . i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes . this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor . ok . . . . . this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother ( jack palance ? ) or small children . the language is filthy , the jokes are ( very ) crude , and the sex talk is about as graphic as you ' ll find anywhere . what ' s amazing , however , is that the movie is still a sweet love story . my girlfriend and i both loved it . steve carell is terrific , but ( like the office ) the supporting cast really makes the film work . all of the characters have their flaws , but they also have depth and likability . everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect . i can ' t wait to get the dvd . i ' m sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines . 
POS just came out of a sneak preview for this film . it had me laughing every 30 secs . the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn ' t bought that large coke . there are definitely some lulls , but , overall , highly entertaining . the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in " bruce almighty " and will ferrell " anchorman : the legend of ron burgendy " in their movies . paul rudd is hilarious as always . i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas ( like p . s . ) . i think that seth rogen should be getting more work , because he so freaking talented and engaging . leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments . i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac . however , if you ' re easily offended , don ' t see this movie . if you ' re a rabid feminist , don ' t see this movie . and , please , not matter what , even if you think you ' re one of those " hip " parents , don ' t take your kids to this movie . sure , you should let your teens go see this movie , just don ' t watch it with them . it would make for some incredibly awkward moments . 
POS what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme ! the summary from taxman is great . i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing , i must have been 10 / 11 at the time i watched it . i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead ' s very blond hair , and his permanently sad state . the theme was played on a flute i recall - although i cannot remember how it went . i think the intro showed him playing it - or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad ? maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune , but at least i now know it is not just me . 
POS this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations . there are constant references to assembly line production , where workers are treated as cogs in a machine , overseen by managers wielding clipboards , controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed , and firing workers ( stanley ) who meet all criteria ( as his supervisor says , are always on time , are hard workers , do good work ) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake . < br / > < br / > this system destroys families - stanley has to send his father to a nursing home ( where he quickly dies ) after stanley loses his job . iris ' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant . references are made to the fact that now , with declining wages , both partners need to work , the implication being that there ' s nobody left at home to care for the kids . iris ' husband is dead from an illness , and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care , the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care . iris ' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and / or teeth job ( even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them ) . the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail ( presumably , he ' s also black , and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates ) . she remarks that he , like her , " is doing time " - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave . < br / > < br / > stanley , however , still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism . he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father ' s traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract , as iris ' brother in law does ( suggesting that he " married the wrong sister " ) . he does not , as iris says , conform to the work - eat - sleep routine of everyone else ; rather , he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way , in a sort of bauhaus ideal . this was the dream of early modernists and 1920 ' s socialists ( such as the bauhaus ) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs , allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations . he is also outside of traditional gender relations . he cooks , he cleans , he cares for his family , and he knows how to iron . iris , on the other hand , lives in a traditionally male role - she ' s a factory worker , the mains source of income for her ( extended ) family , and she brings stanley into the public realm , traditionally off - limits to women . by teaching him to read and write , she gives him access to the world of knowledge , also traditionally gendered male . < br / > < br / > literacy here is used as a metaphor for the ( traditionally masculine ) public realm and the systems of circulation ( monetary , vehicular , cultural ) that enable participation in the public realm . without this access , stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning . he is excluded from all regular circulations , unable to participate in the monetary ( can ' t open a bank account ) , in the vehicular ( can ' t get a driver ' s license , can ' t ride the bus ) , and in the social ( he asks if he exists if he can ' t write his name ) . < br / > < br / > after learning to read , he grabs books on auto repair , farming , and spirituality ( the bible ) . the word of god is therefore relativized , placed on the same value plane as how - to books . in fact , organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex . it is , however , acknowledged as a moral force - iris , clearly a character devoted to living a " good " life , mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching . < br / > < br / > once able to read , he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan , a car , and a house , taking his place at the head of the family , the breadwinner . presumably , he ' s an industrial designer , dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce . this ending , probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film , is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn ' t forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel - good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line . < br / > < br / > now that , according to the pundits , we ' ve comfortably moved on to post - industrial capitalism , the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel , as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period . < br / > < br / > nevertheless , it ' s highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain . disregard the ending , and it ' s close to a perfect 10 . 
POS i wish kids movies were still made this way ; dark and deep . there was ( get this ) character development ( and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character ) , plot development , superb animation , emotional involvement , and a rational , relatable , and consistent theme . if not for the handful of song - and - dance routines , you would never have thought this was a kids movie , and this is why i give it such a high rating . this movie is an excellent film , let alone for a kids ' movie . which brings me to my second point : this has got to be the darkest " kids ' " movie i ' ve seen in quite some time , this coming from a 22 - year - old . i ' d be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie , and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ( ala " jurassic bark " , for those of you who are ' futurama ' fans ) , and this is what makes this movie so good . just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don ' t normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad ; in fact , it means it succeeded . good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh ; good horror movies are supposed to make us scared ; good sad movies are supposed to make us sad . my point is , good movies are supposed to move you , not simply entertain ; this movie moved me . < br / > < br / > also , this movie is incredibly violent by today ' s standards for a kids ' movie and contains subject matter that , by today ' s standards , may not be suitable for some children . parents , i ' d say watch it first . i ' m not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing , but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me . 
POS what a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe . i don ' t know how come the rating of the movie is 7 . 3 it should be 9 . 3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect . you should watch this movie once , i think twice well it ' s up to u . anyways i love this movie and it ' s not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history . but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya . the only thing i don ' t like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if a r rahman would be the music director but anyways we can ' t do anything about that so ya . 
POS " and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom " - anais nin marcel proust says , " the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes . " author and screenwriter antwone fisher joined the u . s . navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes . based on his autobiography " finding fish " written many years after the events , his story is dramatized in the film antwone fisher , denzel washington ' s first directorial effort . it is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one ' s past to being able to live life in present time . < br / > < br / > required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base , the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up antwone ( derek luke ) recounts his life in sessions with navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( denzel washington ) . he is at first unwilling to talk , but when he begins , the floodgates are opened . after his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison , he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years , suffering humiliation and sexual abuse . according to antwone , the treatment by his foster mother mrs . tate ( novella nelson ) who referred to him only as " nigga " and by his cousin nadine ( yolonda ross ) was in fact much worse than shown on the screen . < br / > < br / > the only friend he has is a local by named jesse ( jascha washington ) who , later in the film , only adds to his feelings of abandonment . it is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in ordinary people and good will hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of washington and luke , though the film ' s attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile . davenport ' s humanity and warmth , however , allows fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and cheryl ( joy bryant ) , his new girlfriend who is also in the navy , supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough . < br / > < br / > with cheryl ' s help and dr . davenport ' s counseling , antwone develops enough self - esteem to return to cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past . what comes through in derek luke ' s incredible performance is antwone ' s longing for acceptance , dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him . comedian mort sahl once said that " people just have to remember what we ' re all here for : to find our way home . . . " antwone fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep , not knowing the joy of being loved . 
POS an adaption of the book ' finding fish ' . this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher ( derek luke ) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist jerome davenport ( denzel washington ) . a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel washington . < br / > < br / > this movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn ' t win an oscar , i think it was because it was released at a bad time that ' s why it was overlooked . i strongly recommend this film to everyone , you ' ll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is antwone fisher . < br / > < br / > if you like inspirational true stories , then watch antwone fisher . < br / > < br / > thank you 
POS the father of the who ' s alcoholic drummer , keith moon , was named arthur . i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie . liza minelli , who usually overacts , did quite a good job in this one , and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn . yes , i agree , sir john stole absolutely every scene . it was a very " different " movie , enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life . we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite . god rest dudley moore ; this was such an enjoyable movie . much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby / affluent . the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing . 
POS this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer / director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud . sadly , gordon , only in his early forties , died soon after completing this , his only feature film . it ' s an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character - driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible . it plays almost like a 1930 ' s - style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes . the plot centers on arthur bach , a drunken , diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $ 750 million inheritance if he doesn ' t marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson , an heiress handpicked by his old - money father and dotty grandmother . of course , he doesn ' t love her and by chance , runs into linda marolla , a working - class waitress ( and of course , aspiring actress ) after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father . < br / > < br / > the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol - fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by moore . that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielgud ' s feisty , acidic turn as hobson , arthur ' s devoted but reality - grounded valet . it ' s the type of role he could play in his sleep , but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings . in probably her most likable film role , liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co - stars by toning down her usual razzle - dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation . < br / > < br / > a pre - " la law " jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive - aggressive note , while barney martin ( jerry ' s dad on " seinfeld " ) steals all his scenes as linda ' s slovenly father ralph . the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald , who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother . and i have to admit that i still can ' t stand the very dated , overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year ' s best song . unfortunately , the 1997 dvd , certainly in need of remastering , has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes . 
POS quite simply the funniest and shiniest film - comedy of all time . . . it ' s certainly on my personal top - ten list . this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale . millionaire heir , arthur bach ( moore ) , is a middle - aged ' child ' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities . he also refuses to leave the bottle . one day he and his personal butler , hobson ( gielgud ) , go shopping at bergdorf goodman ' s and run into petty larcenist , linda ( minnelli ) . arthur and linda ' s chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film . there are hilarious set pieces aplenty . in one such scene , arthur ( drunk throughout most of the story ) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human ' siren ' ( " my husband has a gun ! ! ! ! ) . performances by everyone involved should be duly noted : geraldine fitzgerald plays arthur ' s loving - yet - ruthless grandmother , sir john gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll - isms ( he took home the oscar for this one ) , and christopher cross provides the main theme song ( oscar winner " best that you can do " ) . it ' s a shame the late dudley moore passed away last month ( march 2002 ) . 
POS a single mother ( diane keaton ) finds herself working several minimum - wage jobs . when she gets fired , she finds that she is unable to support her sons ( michael seater and colin roberts ) , the latter of whom has asthma . then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs . soon enough , she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling . her life comes crashing down , especially when her kids , namely her oldest son , find out the truth and threaten to leave her . then , she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug lords who she worked for ? < br / > < br / > wow ! this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i have ever seen ! diane keaton overacts a lot , and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing . she is much better suited to drama than to comedy . however , the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater , who plays her oldest son . he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family . his acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs . colin roberts , who plays the younger son , also does a great job . < br / > < br / > a movie well worth watching , especially because of the acting from michael seater and diane keaton ! 
POS i have no idea what people are complaining about . i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it . stone once again delivered a great character . she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct . she still has those smart but tricky answers . although sharon may be 48 years old . . . she looks amazing ! i don ' t care if she ' s as fake as a barbie . she looks good and that ' s that . basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first . sex , violence , and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours ! half the people commenting on this movie haven ' t even saw it . so don ' t listen to them . 
POS at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm , strong , seamless performance as derek bliss . his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films ( the leading man , no looking back ) . but , in case anyone is still wondering , yes , jon bon jovi can act . he can act well and that ' s come to be expected of him . it ' s easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh - 1 . < br / > < br / > i generally would not watch a horror movie . i ' ve come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot . what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along . the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets . so , gore fans might be disappointed , but story fans will not . < br / > < br / > unlike an action film like u - 571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast , we get a chance to know " the good guys " and actually care what happens to them . a few scenes are left unexplained ( like derek ' s hallucinations ) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel . unfortunately , with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film , that sequel will never happen . these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series . < br / > < br / > is this the best film i ' ve ever seen in my life ? no . is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained ? yes . it won ' t leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won ' t leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either . if you ' re somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover , this film is for you . it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other . < br / > < br / > 
POS i loved it so much that i bought the dvd and the novel at the same time . the chemistry between the actors ( including little arthur ) is amazing and thrilling . < br / > < br / > it could have used a bit more screen time for the yummy frederick lawrence ( played by james purefoy ) . and gilbert markham was amazingly " on it " from the very start of the movie . < br / > < br / > the one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was rupert graves as arthur huntingdon . i adore him in forsyte saga , and all else i ' ve seen him in . but he outdoes himself here as arthur . in my wildest dreams i could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as arthur huntingdon . but he does . and i love it . and i love him . 
POS contains spoilers ! < br / > < br / > i saw an advert for this on a video . then my sister discovered that we had the book so i read it . i rented the video on the same day i finished the book . i thought it was very memorable as was the book . the cast was brilliant . tara fitzgerald was excellent as helen and rupert graves was hateful as arthur . the costumes , music and settings are stunningly beautiful . < br / > < br / > warning ! don ` t read any more if you haven ` t watched this < br / > < br / > on the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violence . this is why the video is rated 15 . there are some other things that have been thrown in . after the first part , i felt that the accuracy went downhill . while the book is better than this , i am glad i have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the book , are fans of bronte or like costume dramas ( i am all 3 ! ) as long as you fastforward through the sex scenes . the book is rather underated . anne brontes books don ` t seem to be that widely read or well known as jane erye or wuthering heights which have made it into television and film several times . another thing . when i read the book , i was surprised at how much religion ther was in it , but here they had axed that all out ! < br / > < br / > 7 \ 10 
POS this movie struck home for me . being 29 , i remember the ' 80 ' s and my father working in a factory . i figured , if i worked hard too , if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream , the house , a few kids , a car all to call my own . i ' ve noted however , without a degree in something ( unlike my father that quit at ninth grade ) and a keen sense of greed and laziness , you can ' t get anywhere . < br / > < br / > i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs . it ' s made for tv , and i just saw it an hour ago . ic an ' t find it anywhere ! i ' d love to show this to my friends , my pseudo friends , family and other relatives , see what they think and remind them that once upon a time , americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished ! ! i think the feeling is still there , but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas . . . 
POS this movie is pretty cheesy , but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it ' s principles . there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well . < br / > < br / > the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie . < br / > < br / > i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran . sure it ' s not all that well done , but the premise is not at all bad . < br / > < br / > tom 
POS everybody ' s got bills to pay , and that includes christopher walken . < br / > < br / > in vietnam , a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows , including christopher walken . following a mad max 3 ( ! ) thunderdome fight , and a short massacre later . walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other . < br / > < br / > cut to the present ( 1991 ) , and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente . he ' s successful at first , but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank , he ' s forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television . this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly , which leads walken to assemble the old squad ( even though he wasn ' t actually part of that squad to begin with ) , in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of people . < br / > < br / > mcbain is a monumentally stupid film , but for all that it ' s also a good laugh , and action packed too . this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression , or even breaking a window ? also , it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering . < br / > < br / > there ' s plenty of b - movie madness to chew on here , from michael ironside ' s diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence , to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes , to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente , and let ' s not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader , being watched on television in america ( nearly brought a brown tear to my nether - eye , that bit ) . < br / > < br / > it ' s out there for a quid . buy it if you have a sense of humour . see how many times you can spot the camera crew too . 
POS ah , mcbain the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by " the simpsons " but it will also always  to me personally , at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90 ' s action flick ; directed by the cool dude who brought us " the exterminator " and starring two of the most ultimately badass b - movie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside ( the latter with a cute little macho ponytail ) . i guess " mcbain " will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure , because there ' s no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture . the film is unimaginably preposterous ( most action heroes take on a small gangster posse mcbain takes on an entire country ) and yet takes itself way too seriously . the script is a non - stop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations , nonsensical twists , compulsory sentimental interludes , grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings . it ' s a totally delirious movie ; i loved it . < br / > < br / > vietnam pow mcbain ' s life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war . they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos ' debt . eighteen years later , santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia . santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he ' s publicly executed on el presidente ' s balcony . his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower . mcbain and his former vietnam buddies , who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world , charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop - ass . < br / > < br / > okay , let ' s not fool each other here . the fact you ' re reading a user - comment on " mcbain " already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low - budget b - movie action . one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of " mcbain " . this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it . heck , i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list ( like the preposterous and needless heroic self - sacrifice of a soldier who doesn ' t even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbain ' s squad ) , but what ' s the point ? you definitely know not to expect a 100 % coherent and plausible masterpiece . we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie , and it ' s maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out ! this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel . please don ' t expect another " apocalypse now " . this particular motion picture relies on the ruff ' n tuff acting performances of the macho leads , a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of " brothers in arms " . 
POS this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic . much much better than 90 % of the scream rip - offs out there ! i even hope they come up with a sequel ! 
POS martin sheen , michelle phillips , stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother ' s death . mr . sheen , mr . margolin and mr . morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles ; ms . phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made - for - tv movie ( twenty - five years ago ) , by supplying the " sex interest " in an otherwise sexless film . the real star , however , is the " california kid " ; a 1934 ford coupe , borrowed from " jake " jacobs , put before a camera and given a workout that ' ll leave the viewer panting , gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation . < br / > < br / > the action scenes are spectacular , ( although some of the dialog is a bit lame ) making for a fine evening ' s diversion . this is how all " car movies " should be made . < br / > < br / > try to catch this one on the late movie channel ; it ' s well worth the missed sleep . 
POS in 1958 , clarksberg was a famous speed trap town . much revenue was generated by the sheriff ' s department catching speeders . the ones who tried to outrun the sheriff ? well , that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser . for example , in the beginning of the movie , a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths , if i recall correctly . then one day , a stranger drove into town . possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world . michael mccord . even his name is a car name , as in mccord gaskets . in possibly the ultimate hot rod . a black flamed ' 34 ford coupe . the colors of death , evil and hellfire . he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose . he checks out the lay of the land . he is the brother of one of the sheriff ' s victims . he knows how his brother died . the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff . there ' s only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so " this ain ' t a - ever gonna happen again to anyone " : recreate the chase and settle the contest hot - rodder style to the death . he goes out to the curve and practices . the sheriff knows mccord knows . the race begins . . . this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road . 
POS two warring shop workers in a leather - goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box - number aliases . within this simple idea and an everyday setting , lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit , drama , poignancy and irony that never lets up . stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions , and the rest of the well - developed characters have their own sub - plots and in - jokes . although wrongly eclipsed by stewart ' s big films of 39 / 40 ( destry , philadelphia story , mr smith ) this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films . 
POS every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production . i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made . everyone involved is perfect ; script , acting , direction , sets and editing . whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance , and the supporting cast are magnificent , it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was . her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve . lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best . watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take - breathtaking . 
POS " the shop around the corner " is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch . in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan , it ' s filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart . they ' re the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs . in fact , the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn ' t make anymore . ( the makers of " you ' ve got mail " claim their film to be a remake , but that ' s just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise . ) anyway , if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940 ' s , you ' ll find " the shop around the corner " to be nothing short of wonderful . just as good with repeat viewings . enjoy ! 
POS i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie - i probably know the entire dialog backwards - yet i am drawn to it time and again . < br / > < br / > set in hungary , a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor " kralik " who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavan ' s innocent " klara " . kralik secretly becomes klara ' s pen - friend , and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his ( kralik ' s ) letters . clearly kralik is besotted with klara - but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the " pen - friend " . confused ? well you wont be - this story has a sweet , almost sugary ending - but we all know it is the ending we all want . < br / > < br / > other characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role , this time as the shop ' s owner " hugo matuschek " , felix bressart as " pirovitch " , kralik ' s confidant . joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant " vadas " - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning . < br / > < br / > finally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over - confident upstart of a shop junior " pepi katona " . < br / > < br / > recently re - made as " you ' ve got mail " starring tom hanks & meg ryan for me is not as good as the original - although i suspect younger audiences would disagree . < br / > < br / > if this film is on in your area over christmas , i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine , put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy . 
POS masayuki suo , who directed this fine film , is on a role . after the decent " fancy dance " and the classic ( in japan , anyway ) college - sumo comedy " shiko funjatta " , suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success . < br / > < br / > the story is engaging . we both laugh often ( naoto takenaka is hilarious , as he is in suo ' s two previous films ) and really root for the characters . but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society - real life in japan . suo has a knack for showing real - life activities with entertaining flair . the result is a movie that will pull you in , make you laugh , make you think , and both entertain you and give you insight into today ' s japan . < br / > < br / > also look for the the main 8 actors from shiko funjatta , as they all appear again in various roles , from supporting characters ( takenaka ) to short cameos ( many ) . 
POS im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film . it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy , i don ' t know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller . i saw this at about 2 . 00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it . if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad , the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better . i don , t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video , i for one would buy this if it , s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x - files story attached to it . government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings . overall a good film . 
POS i enjoyed the story by itself , but the things that i learned about wwi planes & boats , make this movie a must see . the close - ups on the plane & the torpedo boat & how they were used were completely new to me . i heartily recommend . 
POS i first came across this film when i read a book ( written in the 1970s ) about the career of mitchell leisin . i have to admit that over the years i have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality . swing high , swing low was supposed to be one of his best . while it did not bore me , it did not impress me as much as hold back the dawn , death takes a holiday , kitty , or even golden earings . i suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked . < br / > < br / > working at paramount leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals . most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre . it ' s true that twice standards appeared in his films , but they were really rare cases : " cocktales for two " appeared in murder at the vanities , and " mona lisa " came out of captain carey , u . s . a . but the rest of the score for murder at the vanities was forgettable . " mona lisa " was the only tune in captain carey . it shouldn ' t have been this way - leisin ' s studio had rogers and hart working for it in the early 1930s . why couldn ' t he have been assigned to a project with them ? the score for swing high , swing low , is pleasant but forgettable . unfortunately , the movie is centered in the entertainment world , as fred macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player ( he even works carole lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet ) . the song ( sung by lombard ) about how her lover ' s playing thrills her , is important to the plot . it works in the film , but it would have been better if the song was more memorable . < br / > < br / > there is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that lombard works on , as a manicurist . she is constantly being bullied by her boss franklin pangborn ( the ship ' s barber ) . then the ship is entering into the panama canal , and we see macmurray as a soldier , who ' s enlistment is ending shortly . their first scene together has a nice leisin touch in it : macmurray is talking to lombard , she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock . nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit . < br / > < br / > the film follows the rise and fall of the skid johnson ( macmurray ) as he meets lombard , and begins his reputation as a trumpet player , but meets the " other woman " in the film , dorothy lamore . the best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with lombard , and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter ( his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a macmurray character - even his darker figures like walter neff or mr . sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the caine mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol . < br / > < br / > lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by macmurray . lamore has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it , but one stands out is her attempt to get macmurray onto the wagon again . in his opening bit pangborn is fine . rarely noticed in films , small part actor carl judels is effective as a fair weather fan / friend of macmurray , who drops him as he goes under ( though he gives him a hand - out ) . < br / > < br / > charles butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual , but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he , his girlfriend , macmurray , and lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that macmurray is insisting is true . it was a nice , subtle moment . if only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of diffident humor . 
POS the 100 black and white half - hour episodes of the early situation comedy " mr . peepers " were originally broadcast from 1952 - 55 on nbc . like a lot of baby boomers this and " ding dong school " are my earliest memories of television . since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts . < br / > < br / > " mr . peepers " is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value . it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like " the honeymooners " and " i love lucy " . the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows ; which is probably why they still seem contemporary . < br / > < br / > " mr . peepers " , which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone , may appear slow and dull in comparison . but it ' s really more a matter of adjusting to the different style . once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers . credit should be give to the show ' s producer , fred coe , a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out ( " philco television playhouse " , " lights out " , " playhouse 90 " , " producers showcase " , " playwrights 56 " , " fireside theatre " , etc . ) even on kinescope . < br / > < br / > " mr . peepers " offered a much more gentle style with wally cox ( to be the voice of " underdog " a few years later ) in the title role , robinson peepers , a mild - mannered high school science teacher . his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer . < br / > < br / > the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast . tony randall played his brash best friend , history teacher harvey weskit . jack warden played frank whip , the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements . < br / > < br / > there is some love interest competition involving the school ' s nurse , nancy remington ( patricia benoit ) , with viewers quickly aligning with mr . peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy . their on - screen marriage near the end 1953 - 54 season captured national attention , an early version of the " who shot j . r . ? " frenzy . < br / > < br / > then again , what do i know ? i ' m only a child . 
POS while the ' special effects ' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some , i have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age . the story of this girl ' s survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years , and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen . < br / > < br / > the fact that this is a true story , and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie . each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be riveted to the television , drinking in each scene with an interest i cannot explain . i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult ( and with a jaded view of the world ) it may not be as enjoyable to some . i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son . < br / > < br / > this , like many other movies , is not for everyone . if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories , are partial to peru / macchu picchu and / or the amazon , then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years . 
POS a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema . i never thought jordi molla could be such a great director , after all , i really don ' t care much for his choice in movies . however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all . . . something i always enjoy ! it hasn ' t enjoyed much good press and i really don ' t think it ' ll ever be released in the us market . we ' ll have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that . . . i don ' t want to say much about the story because i don ' t want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it ( like sooooooooooo many ) , before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on . 
POS not a bad martial arts film . fight scenes were good . michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme . story worked without foul language and too much blood . screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works . it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre . she likes the art and having strong women promenant . it was definitely worth watching . i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers . 
POS this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler . when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street , especially the character eloise who ' s a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle , like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star . this film , like most race films , keeps people watching because of the great entertainment . race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era . the dancing styles , the music , dressing styles , you ' ll love it . this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood , it would of had better scenery , better filming , and more money which would make any movie better . but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has . i have to say out of all micheaux ' s films , swing is the best ! the movie features singers , dancers , actresses , and actors who were popular but forgotten today . doli armena , a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky . the sexy , hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame . < br / > < br / > adding further info . . . popular blues singer of the 20 ' s and 30 ' s cora green is the focus of the film , she ' s mandy , a good , hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women . a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive , curvy woman by the name of eloise ( played hazel diaz , a hot - cha entertainer in the 30 ' s ) and a fight breaks out . then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle . lena provides mandy with a home , a job , and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith ( played by hazel , i guess she ' s playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name ) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior . when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg , lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy . tall , long , lanky , but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well . pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him , he might shape up . there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith ( hazel diaz ) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that ' s not enough , she almost gets into a fight with mandy again . in between there ' s great entertainment by chorus girls , tap dancers , shake dancers , swing music , and blues singing . there ' s even white people watching the entertainment , i wonder where micheaux found them , there ' s even a scene where there ' s blacks and whites sitting together at the club , micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films , he should be commended for such a bold move . < br / > < br / > this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux . this movie is one of the best of the race film genre , its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business . < br / > < br / > no these early race films may not be the best , can ' t be compared with hallelujah , green pastures , stormy weather , cabin in the sky , carmen jones , or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film - making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person ' s eyes . these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life , be beautiful , classy , and elegant , and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood . most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren ' t the best , but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time , micheaux and spencer williams couldn ' t afford nina mae mckinney , josephine baker , ethel waters , fredi washington , paul robeson , rex ingram , and more of the bigger stars , so micheaux and other black and white race film - makers would use nightclub performers in their movies , some were good , some weren ' t great actors and actresses , but i think micheaux and others knew most weren ' t good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent , they just wanted their stories told , and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films . for some true actors / actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work , especially if they didn ' t want to play hollywood stereotypes , so i think you ' ll be able to spot the true actors / actresses from the nightclub performers . these race films are very historic , they could have been lost forever , many are lost , maybe race films aren ' t the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didn ' t start out great in the beginning . i think if the race film genre continued , it would have better . if your looking for great acting , most race films aren ' t the ones , but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films , than watch race films . there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast , moon over harlem , body and soul , paradise in harlem , keep punching , sunday sinners , dark manhattan , broken strings , boy ! what a girl , mystery in swing , miracle in harlem , and sepia cinderella , that not only has good entertainment but good acting . 
POS a damn good movie ! one that is seriously underrated . the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain , but also their hope for the future . whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here , but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character . i wish she was in more movies . < br / > < br / > this movie should have a higher rating . i give it a 10 / 10 . 
POS i haven ' t yet read kurt vonnegut ' s mother night ( though i ' ve read other books of his , all outstanding pieces of satire and game - changing novel pieces ) . after seeing keith gordon ' s film adaptation of his book , it will be an immediate must - read in the near future . it ' s the kind of material that i ' m sure if it wasn ' t made in 1995 / 96 as a film , it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post / present - holocaust / ww2 movies are quite popular . except that this is much darker , though even more resonant , about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say the reader . it ' s about the very real danger of pretending in wartime , which is what being a spy in ww2 is really all about . < br / > < br / > it would be one thing if mother night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role - even after the war ends - for howard w . cambpell ( nick nolte ) , which is does . but it ' s also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique . keith gordon is not someone i usually think of as a director of really strong material ( more - so i think back to him as an actor , oddly enough featured briefly with vonnegut himself in back to school ) , but this is a revelation . he takes the story of campbell as a story of a fractured life : a german propaganda master ( the " only american left in berlin " ) , who is actually a spy for the americans but can never have his identity revealed , and was before a playwright who really belonged to " a nation of two " , himself and his wife ( sheryl lee ) . it follows him from his prison cell , awaiting trial in israel in 1961 , as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a ' pretend ' nazi , and then in 1960 in semi - hiding in a new york apartment , which is where the bulk of the film takes place . < br / > < br / > mother night can be quite heavy , like on a level one might associate with the pianist , but on another more emotional - cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film . gordon , by way of vonnegut , is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing , except the memory ( and then later a weird transposition ) of his long lost love in a " sister " who has come back to him in nyc , so he ' s left to his own devices when he befriends a painter ( alan arkin , very very good here ) , and then is found out as a nazi - in - hiding by a white supremacist newsletter , leading wackos to his apartment . on the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story , but not a thing is straightforward . the ' something ' of this man ' s life is staggering , but it ' s ultimately of his own choosing . campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end , but the same conclusions might be reached ( and , in a way , mirrors the line goebbels said ) : the bigger the lie , the more people believe it . that is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power . < br / > < br / > but oh , it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic - comic tale , or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances ( which is does : nolte is at his very best here , and sheryl lee , who we might remember from twin peaks as laura palmer , stuns in multiple roles , especially in the scene when she reveals she ' s not ' really ' helga ) . it ' s also a gorgeously shot film , with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character , or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time ( watch the scene where an old campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant , the juxtaposition of faces is great ) . and the music selections rise the level of tragedy . it could be argued some of the music is too much , but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic , solemn about human nature . < br / > < br / > it ' s not always an easy film to take emotionally , and some of the twists do have that tinge of " whoa " as in any spy story . but it ' s the subversion from vonnegut that sticks through , the way of taking appearance and performance , of life imitating art imitating life imitating death , and making it into something worth remembering . i have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film ( or the other way around ) , but at the moment it ' s hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post ww2 / holocaust storytelling . 
POS if you ' ve read mother night and enjoyed it so much ( as i did ) that you just have to see the movie , understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut ' s writing - that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself , and that you can ' t put a human mind on the screen . his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance . i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book , but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen . does this mean that the movie misses the mark ? of course not . in my opinion , the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book ( this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page ) . it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america ' s true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense . i ' ve seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut ' s genius and loses grip on his own craft . i would not place this movie as one of the best i ' ve seen , but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching . by taking vonnegut ' s " voice " out of the movie ' s narration or trying to insert it however it can , mother night tells his story brilliantly , and preserves the story ' s fundamental lessons without confusion , distraction , or disappointment . 
POS hard to categorize the film - perhaps it ' s an avant garde spy thriller ? mother night is a very good vonnegut novel , and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film . the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book . the " indie " approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it . these days , i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses . and normally that is too bad , but not in this case . mother night has tight direction and a solid cast . nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older , still has that " everyman " persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters . sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always . i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry . i guess making your debut as a dead girl ( twin peaks ) with little air time isn ' t the choicest of roles , even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon . anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don ' t have to read the book to understand the movie . in fact , given today ' s geopolitical realities , the novel ' s premise may appear dated , and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding ( i am talking to you , fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography , history , and lord knows what other subjects ! ) . 
POS this movie pleasantly surprised me . it has a touching , slightly off - center approach that never loses your attention . this is a movie i never heard about , but if you want a " sleeper " , this is it . great writing , production , and acting . i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful . nick nolte , sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous . why wasn ' t more made of this movie ? 
POS reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one . she appears like a fresh scrubbed face " tween " slight and stringy , but undeniably reese . < br / > < br / > i have always liked her as an actor , and had no idea she started this young with her career , go figure . i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on . i say that because whenever i have watched her perform , the characters thus far , in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character , quite nicely in fact . < br / > < br / > anyway , my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland , somehow i assumed that was her first time up " at bat " not so , well done reese 
POS loved the film ! this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london , both of which are two of my favorites . must say that no matter how many times i ' ve seen this movie i can ' t help but tear up . one of those movies that should become a classic for all . 
POS < br / > < br / > it ' s a generic coming - of - age story - - think " the member of the wedding , " " summer of ' 42 , " " a summer place , " even " little women " - - and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music , not used slow - motion , or played down the golden - lit prettiness of the setting . otherwise , it ' s done with rare emotional perfect - pitch . nothing ' s forced , every line has feeling , and the pacing is just right . even the below - a - list casting helps : bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material . in particular , witherspoon is excellent : her line readings are fresh and original , and her body language is just right for a gawky , hoydenish 14 - year - old on the eve of womanhood . waterston is also very fine , even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck . < br / > < br / > one senses that the film ' s makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects - - no big stars , no big car crashes , no special effects - - and consciously decided to make the best possible movie , box office be damned . it ' s intimate and honest , and it sticks to the ribs . if you find yourself misting up at the end , you don ' t have to feel you ' ve been duped . 
POS " the man in the moon " is a pretty good movie . it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects . i wouldn ' t say the film was terribly original , but what is these days ? < br / > < br / > the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles . i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age , and does quite a good job . jason london does a fine job as well . and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston , who did a fantastic job with his role . i really liked sam ' s character ( matthew trant ) a lot . at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread , but in the end you really like his character . the rest of the cast was very good as well . < br / > < br / > if you ' re into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you , then you ought to watch this film . i ' d suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you ' d be interested in , then go for it . anyhow , hope you enjoy the film , thanks for reading , < br / > < br / > - chris 
POS as i watched this movie i began to feel very nostalgic . as a child growing up in a rural area i felt as if i was a kid again ! the swimming pond ( it ' s called a " tank " in central texas ) , the running through the countryside like a wild free spirit ! the story was very believable and i totally lost it and cried toward the end . through the pain we go through in life . . . life goes on and there can be forgiveness . 
POS after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for " pushing daisies " , and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode , i thought it was about time i said what i thought of pd . < br / > < br / > first off , to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show : something along the lines of " i expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction " . realistic , on this show ? pushing daisies is , truly , pure and utter escapism . it ' s colour palette , the dialogue used , the scenarios , situations , music : all of it , to me , is just an escape from everyday life . an escape from the mundane and boring . it is here where pushing daisies exceeds exceptionally well pushing daisies isn ' t for everyone : a large majority of the television audience don ' t " get " it , for some people it ' s just too out there and silly . but for people like me , even from the first episode i watched of it ( season 2 ' s " frescorts " ) and i was just blown away by the show . from then on , i bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my dvd player . other people i know can ' t stand it , it really seems to be like marmite . < br / > < br / > the show follows the adventures of ned , the piemaker , with a magic finger , who brings back childhood sweetheart charlotte charles , works in association with private investigator emerson cod , owns the pie - hole and employs waitress olive snook . completing the main cast members are aunts lily and vivian , whom charlotte ( chuck ) is never allowed to see . they live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life , everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour , and narrated by jim dale . < br / > < br / > other than outlining the basics of the show , i really can ' t praise it much more without saying : just watch it . despite being screwed over by the writer ' s guild of america strike , with only 22 episodes ever to be made , it provides wonderful plot twists , story lines , characters and situations while providing ( for me ) a satisfying ending ( yes , i could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed , but i was still happy with the way it went out ) . whether it is creative or just pretentious , for a lot of people ( me included ) it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing , and i hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so i ' m not left with just 22 , 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be . 
POS this adaptation of m . r . james ' s short story ' a view from a hill ' was first shown on british television in 2005 , on the little watched digital channel bbc 4 . i saw that it was being repeated again on bbc 4 , and decided to give it a go , remembering the bbc ' s successful 1970 ' s adaptations of other m . r . james stories including ' whistle and i ' ll come to you my lad ' and ' the signalman ' . though not in the same class as these masterpieces , ' a view from a hill ' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama . < br / > < br / > a historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts . whilst out in the countryside , he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years . but what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named gallows hill ? and what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation ? whilst not scary in any way , i enjoyed this little production , and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation . as it is , it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome . < br / > < br / > i give it 7 out of 10 . 
POS the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h . g . wells ' great novel , " war of the worlds " . this is perhaps the least well - known and very probably the best of them . no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it , but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place : the last year of the 19th century , 1900 using wells ' original setting , in and near woking , england . < br / > < br / > imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as " spoilers " . that might apply with some films , where the ending might actually be a surprise , but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world , it seems positively silly . i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature , so let ' s get right to the chase . the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease , against which they have no immunity . if that ' s a spoiler , so be it ; after a book and 3 other films ( including the 1953 classic ) , you ought to know how this ends . < br / > < br / > this film , which follows wells ' plot in the main , is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th / early 20th century photography . although filmed in a widescreen aspect , the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity . the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs ( rather than black ) . colors are often reminiscent of hand - tinting . at other times , colors are washed out . these variations are typical of early films , which didn ' t use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality , even going from black / white to sepia / white to blue / white to reddish / white and so on  as you ' ll see on occasion here . the special effects are deliberately retrograde , of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic " feel " . some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of big ben . the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours . some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd , particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair . < br / > < br / > this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells ' original narrative  as has been noted . viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story . wells ' description of the martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed . when the martian machines appear , about an hour into the film , they too give a good impression of how wells described them . both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective ( primarily ) of rural england  plus a few scenes in london ( involving the narrator ' s brother ) . the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark ( big ben ) , but at least doesn ' t dwell unduly on the devastation of london . < br / > < br / > the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise , despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines . the narrator , traveling about to seek escape , sees much of what wells terms " the rout of mankind " . he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality . they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest , where they discover an awful fact : the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene . wells adds that after eating they set up " a prolonged and cheerful hooting " . the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder ( cheers from the gallery ; british curates are so often utterly insufferable ) . < br / > < br / > this film lasts almost 3 hours , going through wells ' story in welcome detail . it ' s about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact . a word about the acting : don ' t expect award - winning performances . they ' re not bad , however , the actors are earnest and they grow on you . most of them , however , have had very abbreviated film careers , often only in this film . the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana , in his 2nd film . the curate is john kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing . the brother ( " henderson " ) is played with some conviction by w . bernard bauman in his first film . the artilleryman , the only other sizable part , is played by james lathrop in his first film . < br / > < br / > this is overall a splendid film , portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it . despite its slight defects , it is far and away better than any of its hyped - up competitors . if you want to see h . g . wells ' war of the worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film ! 
POS the h . g . wells classic has had several incarnations . the 05 ' speilburg version and the classic 53 ' version but only this one stays completely true to the book . nothing is changed nothing is removed . < br / > < br / > originally released as a 3 - hour film . the director re - cut the film down to 2 - hours of pure excellence . its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that " wells would be proud of " the story is as everyone remembers . martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines . the people of 19th century earth are ill - prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth . < br / > < br / > the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget . today b - movies have larger budgets . 
POS it is a well known fact that when gene roddenberry first pitched star trek to nbc , the original pilot episode , the cage , was rejected for being " too cerebral " . when the series was given another chance , roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon , and did so by writing the menagerie , which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still , at the time , an unaired episode . < br / > < br / > this time , rather than exploring a new planet , kirk and his crew are on starbase 11 , paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise , christopher pike ( sean kenney ) , now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident . pike joins his successor on the starship , where an unpleasant surprise awaits : spock , who used to serve under pike , has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for talos iv , a planet which is off - limits ( the punishment is death ) since pike and spock ' s last visit there , 13 years earlier . naturally , being a logical creature , spock turns himself in and arranges a court - martial so that he can justify his actions . < br / > < br / > there ' s no need to say more about the plot , since the rest will play out in part 2 . what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe , by coming up with a particular type of flashback ( to say more would be too much ) that allows everyone , on screen and off , to see what could have been of trek , had nbc not turned down the original project . in particular , it ' s fun to see jeffrey hunter ( who was unable to return in the menagerie ) play pike as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and nimoy ' s early days as spock , whose personality hadn ' t been fully established yet : this is the only time in the entire series that everybody ' s favorite vulcan spontaneously grins . < br / > < br / > in short , not just a great " mystery " episode , but also a treat for those who can ' t be bothered to track down the cage in its original form ( it ' s available as part of the season 3 box set ) . 
POS " going berserk " is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen , period . sure , it ' s kinda low budget , but it ' s a non - stop comedic tour de force . there are tons of memorable quotes . for instance , when his soon - to - be father - in - law asks him how much he earns , candy says " oh , i pull down anywhere between thirty and . . . eleven thousand dollars a year , sir . " oh course , it is candy ' s delivery that sells it . just classic stuff . eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker . a clip of his horrible low budget movie " kung fu u " will have you rolling . < br / > < br / > so if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem , i can ' t recommend this movie enough . 
POS one of john ' s funniest , eugene levy is great in this one as well , just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd , i have it on video tape , but feel that this film deserves dvd ( and extras would be great ) the kung fu uuniversity ( kung fu u ) skit is so very funny , as is the entire film , also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great , this movie never seems to be on tv , but it loses most of it ' s hilarity when edited for broadcast tv , if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ( ebay is a good place to find a copy ) i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd . there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd , and this is one of them . 
POS i thought that this film was very well made , heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless . orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable . how true it is to what really happened i have no idea , but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do . maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30 , 000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged , so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought ? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film . all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn ' t do better in the cinemas . 
POS definitely one of my favourite movies . the story is good , acting is great , all technicals ( especially cinematography ) are sharp and the script is clever . < br / > < br / > heath ledger is terrific as edward ' ' ned ' ' kelly . he is gripping as the legendary outlaw , and is supported well by geoffrey rush , naomi watts and orlando bloom . all action sequences are on point < br / > < br / > the film is edge - of - your seat stuff right up to to the end . one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger , who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in . and makes no mistake here . < br / > < br / > an excellent film all round . 
POS famous was " famous " for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi - main character is in terrible peril , only to be rescued by the hero at the last second . this particular casper is the only one i can remember where death actually takes a hand . but even in death , there is still a happy ending . < br / > < br / > the constant in famous studios cartoons is that " virtue always triumphs " . popeye always gets to his spinach in time , baby huey always out - foxes the fox , little audery always " learns her lesson " . and some fs cartoons are really dark and depressing . < br / > < br / > you have to give them credit . as much as i love looney tunes and " tom and jerry " i don ' t think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than paramount . color , animation , music ( the great winston sharples ) , editing , voices . they were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer . 
POS generally i like something light and fun , so this film shouldn ' t have appealed to me . but it grabbed me from the start . the story of a family ' s choices and challenges seem obvious , but it raises the question over and over : " what if it was my family ? my choice ? " i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt . it was in places difficult to watch , but more difficult to turn away . the story is true , and life is sometimes difficult to watch ! it shows what film - makers can do without sex , violence , or special effects : a good story is a good story all by itself . the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones . like real life , you really don ' t know what ' ll happen next , or why people do the things that they do ! 
POS oh dear . yet another example of " oireland " and religion . no doubt we ' ll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some " hunky and macho freedom fighters " from the ira . well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock . what a superb movie < br / > < br / > the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s . there is a slight problem since they ' re getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they ' re old enough . the story - which is set in the 1950s - then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they ' ll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford . from there things escalate < br / > < br / > let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie he ' d love it and call it a masterpiece ? perhaps i shouldn ' t since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you < br / > < br / > in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i don ' t claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and there ' s no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isn ' t blameless herself . think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this ? this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . there ' s also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member ( that makes a change . we ' re not talking about the devil ' s own here ) but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself < br / > < br / > a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself , all of which i agree with . if there ' s any sort of criticism it ' s that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses 
POS it ' s hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn ' t enough words to give this magnificent , stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves . they should make this the official and only true real hamlet - movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh ' s " hamlet " . < br / > < br / > it ' s a perfect , complete version of the play , potent , massive , earthshaking first - class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of . they ' ve packed over a dozen of world - famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career . every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction . < br / > < br / > the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses . branagh is phenomenal in the leading role . his sharp , irresistible performance is the only one of it ' s kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history . every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end . branagh ' s version of " hamlet " is among the ten best motion pictures ever . 
POS those of the " instant gratification " era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film ' s pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count . the fact is , " the empty acre " is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done . < br / > < br / > if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back - story could have come off the back of a count chocula box , " the empty acre " is the movie for you . < br / > < br / > set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream , " the empty acre " is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six - month - old baby . as the couple ' s weak relationship falls apart , a larger story plays out in the background . at night , a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path , leaving no sign that it was ever there . < br / > < br / > the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening , and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer / director ' s faith in an intellectual audience . < br / > < br / > there seems to be a sub - text concerning the death of the american dream , but i would hardly call the film an allegory . riveting , well acted , and technically astute , " the empty acre " is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love . 
POS this movie surprised me ! not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much ! the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style ! normally i am very careful when this is claimed ! there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn ' t been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action ! the fact that " moon child " would feature a vampire convinced me even more ! how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires ! sounds promising and interesting ! the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow ! it takes it ' s time to set the mood ! this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes ! but " moon child " isn ' t an action movie ! it is a drama about friendship and loyalty ! the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other ! the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends ! the only problem i had was with the plot ! a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip ! example : when one member of the gang dies ( very dramatic moment ) alexander wang sees kei ( hyde ) drinking blood of one of the attackers ! without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren ' t together anymore ! also without a proper reason given son ( alexander wang ) and sho ( gackt ) have to kill each other ! i know that this is done to add some serious drama ! because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced ! apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie ! it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful ! but it just is ! the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere ! 
POS prof . janos rukh ( boris karloff ) discovers radium x - - a powerful force to be used for atomic power . unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark - - and his touch causes instant death . dr . felix benet ( bela lugosi ) develops an antidote - - but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him . < br / > < br / > the plot is silly and the " effects " that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable , but this is still a fun little chiller . it moves quickly , has some great atmosphere ( notice rukh ' s " house " and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night ) and karloff and lugosi ( as always ) give great performances . there is also good acting by franic drake ( as rukh ' s wife ) and violet kemble cooper ( as his mother ) . so it ' s ok but just a notch below all the other karloff / lugosi movies . the plot is just too far - fetched for me to swallow . still i did like this . i give it a 7 . 
POS i have seen several comments here about brando using a southern accent , some of which felt it was a mistake . when this movie was made , racism and discrimination were very strong in the south . the jim crow laws were still in effect . civil rights was in it ' s infancy . could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary , a southern man in love with a woman of another race ? the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the viet nam war ? any thoughts ? < br / > < br / > another comment was made about myoshi umeki appearing " cold " . anyone who has been in japan would understand . the japanese people , at least in my experience , did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers . there were strict social rules , especially for men meeting single women . americans in japan were totally foreign to this culture , and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies . one trait of the japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable , which many american servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed . also remember that at the time represented in the movie , japan had just been defeated , and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance . i think myoshi umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been . watching her interaction with the american actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country . i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who , after i convinced them i was not the typical american male , taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country . 
POS personally , i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made . it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy . and brando should have won for best actor . anyway , the movie is awesome , the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it ! do so , and fall in love . 
POS in the aftermath of watergate , a number of conspiracy movies appeared , such as this one , written by the late adam kennedy ( based on his novel ) . < br / > < br / > gene hackman plays ex - vietnam veteran ' roy tucker ' , a loser who has wound up in prison . he receives visits from marvin tagge ( richard widmark ) , who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted . they offer him freedom , and despite distrusting tagge he accepts . but he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of spiventa ( mickey rooney ) . exactly why is hard to see , as spiventa is an irritating little man who drives tucker mad with persistent talk of sex , not what you want to hear when you are behind bars . < br / > < br / > tagge ' s benefactors kill spiventa before tucker ' s astonished eyes . reunited with wife ellie ( candice bergen ) , and given a new identity ( strangely , he does not attempt to change his appearance . shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start ) , he settles down , but finds there is a catch - tagge wants tucker to do no less than assassinate the president of the united states . he refuses , so tagge has ellie abducted . . . < br / > < br / > i will leave the synopsis here , but i am sure you can guess the rest for yourself . the script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book ( neat trick that ! ) . the people tagge represents are never revealed . the allusions to j . f . k . ' s killing are unmistakable . despite the findings of the warren commission , the doubt as to whether lee harvey oswald acted alone persists to this day . < br / > < br / > this was stanley kramer ' s first movie in years , and while no turkey , it lacks the grip of say john frankenheimer ' s ' the manchurian candidate ' or alan j . pakula ' s ' the parallax view ' . being a left - wing conspiracy movie , it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it . i prefer right - wing ones myself - they are funnier ! ' domino ' has the look and feel of a made - for - t . v . movie , and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the michael caine classic ' get carter ' . < br / > < br / > what makes it watchable are gene hackman and richard widmark . the latter , who sadly passed away earlier this year , is superb as the mysterious tagge , who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated , beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like dominoes . as tucker , the innocent pawn , hackman is marvellous . you have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place . in his shoes , i ' d have fled to the other side of the world , anywhere to get away from these fanatics . hackman ' s love scenes with bergen slow the plot down , and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched . presumably the producers thought so too , which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film ' s entire premise - voiced by british actor patrick allen - warning the audience that ' they ' are out there , and that ' they ' are out to get us . comedian les dawson later spoofed this opening in his b . b . c . show ' the dawson watch ' . < br / > < br / > mickey rooney had earlier worked with kramer on ' its a mad , mad , mad , mad , mad world ' . his ' death ' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture , with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead . < br / > < br / > conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left , but now the right are getting in on the act too . last year , ' taking liberties ' , an absurd concoction of lies and half - truths about tony blair ' s government turned out to be britain ' s answer to ' reefer madness ' . at least , ' domino ' had lovely candice bergen . the best chris atkins ' film could offer was anne widdecombe ! < br / > < br / > surprisingly , ' the domino principle ' was made by sir lew grade , the legendary british television mogul behind ' the saint ' , ' jesus of nazareth ' and ' the muppet show ' . he worked with adam kennedy again in 1980 on ' raise the titanic ! ' , whose failure was so great it sank grade ' s ambitions of being the new louis b . meyer . being somewhat open - minded , i would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy . 
POS offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so - called " fire starters " ( think stephen king ' s snore - fest of a book with the same name ) , but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac ! good special effects ( especially towards the end ) , quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make " wilder napalm " a unique treat of a film to watch . . . if you can find it that is ! on a personal note , i was fortunate enough to snatch it up ( so to speak ) from the two - dollar bin at my local video - rental store . ( * * * out of * * * * * ) 
POS brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom , stephen dedalus , and molly bloom by joseph strick in recreating the endearing portrait of dublin on june 16 , 1904 - bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended ! bravo director strick , screenwriter haines , as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece . gunter grass ' novel , the tin drum filmed by volker schlöndorff ( 1979 ) is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i favorably compare with strick ' s film . < br / > < br / > while there are clearly recognized dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film , there are also recognizable characters , although with different names in the novel . for example , buck mulligan with whom dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent dublin surgeon . < br / > < br / > this film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings . < br / > < br / > brian invinoveritas1 @ aol . com 15 june 2008 
POS for a danish movie , i have to say , that this is very good movie . < br / > < br / > it ' s in a class of its own , yet it has an international potential . < br / > < br / > the movie has a big budget , and is starring famous danish actors , and a few newcomers , who play very well . it can be watched by anyone who like adventures , and a little bit of ' ghost ' movie . < br / > < br / > don ' t be afraid , be thrilled ! 
POS having enjoyed joyce ' s complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph strick ' s and fred haines ' s screenplay , given the fabulous complexity of the original text . however , the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone , naturalism , and levity of the book . < br / > < br / > it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film . i imagine the latter would seem disjointed , with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together , without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot . < br / > < br / > it ' s amazing to see how " filthy " the film is , given that it was shot in dublin in 1967 . the irish film censors only , finally , unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 ( it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club , the irish film theatre , in the late 1970s ) . joyce ' s eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy , it offers many wildly " perverse " episodes . never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967 . < br / > < br / > it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s , respected players all , daring to utter and enact joyce ' s hugely transgressive text with such gusto . < br / > < br / > bravo ! 
POS ever watched . it deals so gently and subtly not only with aids ( which is only alluded ) and gay life , but also with old age , dying and death . it ' s a deep and beautiful movie , ( also visually ) , of a very special director . highly recommanded1 
POS hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery . i confess i have not read the book , despite being an avid agatha christie fan . the adaptation isn ' t without its problems , there were times when the humour , and there were valiant attempts to get it right , was a little overdone , and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed . i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded . however , i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed , it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders , and it really set the atmosphere , what with the dark camera work and dark lighting . the darker moments were somewhat creepy , this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation , maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe , which gave me nightmares . the plot is complex , with all the essential ingredients , though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe , and in some way that is a good thing . the acting was very good , david suchet is impeccable ( i know i can ' t use this word forever but i can ' t think of a better word to describe his performance in the series ) as poirot , and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly . and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole , particularly damian lewis as leonard . all in all , solid mystery but doesn ' t rank along the best . 7 . 5 / 10 bethany cox 
POS really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace ( via drug addiction ) and later redemption . one brother , a self - proclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man - child . the other brother is a hard - working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family ' s expectations for both children . not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be , and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about . i ' d recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love . 
POS that ' s right . the movie is better than the book . don ' t get me wrong , i love the book . but the movie is just so much better . this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best . ( i haven ' t seen scatman crothers and obviously danny lloyd in anything else . ) some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book . but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series . but , i missed a few . the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot . and the redrum scenes are creepier than those in the book . so if you ' re looking for a great movie , get stanley kubrick ' s the shining . but count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks 
POS kubrick proved his brilliantness again , now in a suspense - horror film based on stephen king ' s book titled the same way . jack torrance is a man in his forties , married , with one child , and with a past of trouble and alcoholism . the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather , and there is a well - paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months ; and torrance , who was looking to become a writer , found it perfect . but , the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter , potentially dangerous , and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family . even before they got there , his son danny , who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future ( shinning ) , knew the place wasn ' t good and didn ' t want to go . once they installed themselves in the hotel , things started right but within a month , jack began acting strange , irritated , and depressed . at this point , we know something is going to happen , but don ' t know when and how . scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny , and someone who attacked him violently . they are not alone in this place . later on , jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them , like if they were his family ; among them the famous psychotic caretaker , delbert grady . grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are " intruders " in the hotel . obeying this order , jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things i ' ve ever seen happen here . the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute . 
POS the shining is a weird example of adaptation : it has very little in common with the source novel , written by stephen king , yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master ' s work . this is due to two factors : stanley kubrick ' s masterful direction and jack nicholson ' s chilly acting . < br / > < br / > nicholson plays jack torrance , a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period , unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place : he claims a nice , isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book . therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family : jack , his wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) and their five - year old son danny ( danny lloyd ) . the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something ' s wrong : he has been told by the cook , dick o ' hallorann ( scatman crothers ) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy , the titular shining , which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future , among other things . because of this " gift " , the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny , even though he is quite capable of resisting them . that is not jack ' s case , however , as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife ' s affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts , triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break . < br / > < br / > the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick , though having never worked on this kind of film before , knew exactly what was effective and what wasn ' t , hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths . king criticized the director for changing most of the story , omitting most of the jack / danny subplot ( merely hinted at in the film ) that led to the book ' s emotionally strong climax , and while his disappointment is valid , the omission was actually necessary : the novel dealt with redemption , albeit in an unconventional way , and redemption is a theme kubrick , one of the most famous analysts of human decay , never had a soft spot for . what he is interested in is the mental , and subsequently physical , unbalance that threatens the characters , and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot ( danny ' s encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example ) . < br / > < br / > another criticism king raised was about the actors , especially nicholson : in the writer ' s opinion , his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane , thus undermining the rest of the story . now , it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning , but it is equally true that martin sheen ( king ' s ideal choice for the role ) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson ' s : from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal " here ' s johnny ! " scene , it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part , and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn ' t bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo ' s nest star . as for duvall and lloyd , both add terrific support , the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens ( the omen ' s damien ) and haley joel osment as cinema ' s great horror child icons . one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart ( blonde and beautiful ) and not having much else to do but scream and run , but two things ought to be considered : a ) back in 1980 the " scream queen " cliché wasn ' t one yet ; b ) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera , making the book - movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy ' s eyes . < br / > < br / > irvine welsh , the author of trainspotting , once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work ( and he should know , given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen ) , yet that doesn ' t mean the movie is necessarily bad . the shining proves said point to perfection : very little from the novel , approximately 5 % , is included in the film , but in kubrick and nichlolson ' s hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest , most original horror pictures of all time , which really is saying something given the genre ' s current poor form . 
POS * ! ! - spoilers - ! ! * < br / > < br / > before i begin this , let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the " authorized version " of this movie , remade by stephen king , himself , in 1997 . < br / > < br / > both advantages made me appreciate this version of " the shining , " all the more . < br / > < br / > also , let me say that i ' ve read mr . king ' s book , " the shining " on many occasions over the years , and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work , stanley kubrick ' s retelling of this story is far more compelling . . . and scary . < br / > < br / > kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film . in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay , itself , he acquired the title " magus " beyond question . kubrick ' s genius is like magic . the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 . among his other outstanding credits are : eyes wide shut , 1999 ; full metal jacket , 1987 ; barry lyndon , 1975 ; a clockwork orange , 1971 ; 2001 : a space odyssey , 1968 ; spartacus , 1960 and many more . < br / > < br / > the torrences ( jack , wendy his wife and danny , their son ) are living in the overlook hotel for the winter ; jack has been hired as the caretaker . it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow , until spring when the overlook reopens its doors . it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow - filled summer getaway . < br / > < br / > the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging . it lent to the atmosphere , by having a dark , yet at the same time " welcoming " atmosphere , itself . the furnishings and furniture was all period ( late 70 ' s - early 80 ' s ) , and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant . it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook , it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world . < br / > < br / > the introduction of wendy and danny ' s characters was a stroke of genius . you get the whole story of their past , danny ' s " imaginary friend , " tony , and the story of jack ' s alcoholism all rolled into this nice , neat introductory scene . there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie ; obviously , kubrick saw that from the beginning . < br / > < br / > closing day . again , the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel ( this time , with family in tow ) , the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange . < br / > < br / > the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking , even as the " staff " is moving things out , you get a chance to see the majestic fire places , the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings , dormants and crown moldings in the architecture . " they did a good job ! pink and gold are my favorite colors . " ( wendy torrence ) even the " staff wing " is well designed and beautifully built . < br / > < br / > the maze was a magnificent touch , reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian . when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center , seeing wendy and danny entering , it ' s a magickal moment ; one that tells you right away , there are heavy energies in that house ; there ' s something seriously wrong , already starting . " i wouldn ' t want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out . " ( the hotel manager ) < br / > < br / > scatman cruthers , as dick halloran , was genuine and open in his performance . his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful . you could actually believe you were there in the hotel , taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and " doc . " his explanation of " the shining " to danny was very well delivered , as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel . it was believable and sincere . < br / > < br / > the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself , with the mountains looming behind , the cold air swirling about , mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel , adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie . it also marks the " half - way - to - hell " point , so to speak ; the turning point in the movie . < br / > < br / > shelley duvall ' s portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful . ( so what if she also played olive oyl ? ! it just shows her marvelous diversity ! ) honestly , before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980 , i said , " what ? olive oyl ? * lol * ( popeye was also released in 1980 . ) but i took that back as soon as the movie started . she ' s brilliant . in this fiend ' s opinion , this is her best performance , to date ! ( although i did love her in steve martin ' s " roxanne , " 1987 . ) < br / > < br / > once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you , the viewer , need to be in possession : the torrence ' s past ; danny ' s broken arm ; tony ; the history of the hotel itself ; the fact that danny is not " mental , " but rather clairvoyant instead , and the general layout of the hotel ; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences ; the movie never stops scaring you . < br / > < br / > the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker , delbert grady ( the girls having appeared several times to danny , first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel ) were icons with which danny could identify , and of which he was afraid , at the same time . they were haunting ( and haunted ) , themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed , in a rather graphic and material way . < br / > < br / > kubrick ' s tony was written as an attendant spirit , like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father . he was . . . " the little boy who lives in my mouth . " he would manifest in the end of danny ' s finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny . not like in the book , i realize , where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy , trying to save his father . kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony " took . . . danny . . . over . " the idea of danny ' s older self projecting back to his younger self isn ' t . . . scary . < br / > < br / > the " woman in the shower " scene , done by lia beldan ( about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before , or since ) as the younger woman and billie gibson ( who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since ) , was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting . it was dramatic , and frightening . abhorrent and scary . when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands ; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real . < br / > < br / > jack quickly embarks on his trek from the " jonesing " alcoholic to a certifiable insane person . the degradation of his character ' s mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick . jack ' s instant friendship with lloyd the bartender ( as only alcoholics , would - be mental patients and drug addicts do ) portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him ; namely , alcohol . . . " hair of the dog that bit me . " ( jack torrence ) in jack ' s case , it ' s bourbon on the rocks , at no charge to jack . " orders from the house . " ( lloyd the bartender ) nice play on words . < br / > < br / > when wendy find ' s jack ' s " screenplay " is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over , albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles . . . when he asks from the shadows , " how do you like it ? " and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand . . . is so poignant . it ' s the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is . . . how messed up jack is . it ' s very scary , dramatic and delivers a strong presence . that coupled with danny ' s visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood , imposed over the scene between jack and wendy , and with the confrontational ending to this scene , make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie . < br / > < br / > the " redrum " scene . wow . what do i say ? what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young , troubled son standing over them with a huge knife , talking in that freaky little voice , exclaiming " redrum " over and over ? even if it had no meaning , it would still be as scary as the 7th level of hell . it was something everyone could ( and has ) remember ( ed ) . speaking of memorable scenes . . . < br / > < br / > nicholson ' s final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history . his ad - libbed line , " heeeeere ' s johnny ! " was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror . it also goes down in horror movie history . < br / > < br / > the ending . . ? kubrick ' s ending was perfection . i felt it ended beautifully . no smarm , no platitudinous whining , no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie . just epitomized perfection . that ' s all i ' ll say on the subject of the ending . < br / > < br / > who cares what was taken out ? ! look what kubrick put in . rent it , watch it , buy it . it ' s a classic in the horror genre , and for good reason . it rawks ! ! < br / > < br / > * me being me * . . . take this movie , and sitck it in your stephen king collection , and take the 1997 " authorized " version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section . that ' s where it belongs . . : this movie rates a 9 . 98 from the fiend : . 
POS this story was never among my favourites in christie ' s works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation . the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone , the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the ' crime in the past ' subplot . the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they weren ' t a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting didn ' t allow for that ! i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming ; perhaps its because i ' ve not long re - read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on . < br / > < br / > humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots . sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode ( though i did smile at the ' lemon sole ' throwaway line ) . altogether though , a solid entry in the series though not one of the best . 
POS the journey of hope ( 1990 ) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor turks make so they could live the good life in switzerland . these people are so desperate to live like westerners that they ' ll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land . so many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation . one family braves the cold , the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that there ' s not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel . this problem exists world wide , not just in america . some people tend to forget that . a heart breaker of a film that ' ll leave you wondering why at the end . < br / > < br / > highly recommended . 
POS franco proves , once again , that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema . true , much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus ( necronomicon ) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work . jerry van rooyen ' s splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist ( reynaud ) who may be schizophrenic , or may indeed ( as one mysterious character states ) be a devil , attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits . a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema . 
POS no other movie has made me feel like this before . . . and i don ' t feel bad . like , i don ' t want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie ( 9 months ) nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______ . the reason i say " _____ " is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just can ' t seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up . i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather . no movie has ever done this to me before . never in my life have i wanted cauliflower , milk , and baguettes this much . thank you . - ed < br / > < br / > uh . * clears throat * no words . no thoughts . i don ' t know . i truly don ' t know . - cait 
POS probably bigas luna ' s finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze , eroticism and surrealism . the delicious mathilda may , who spent most of tobe hooper ' s " lifeforce " in the buff , is the object of young biel duran ' s pre - teen lust . he can ' t get may ' s breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother , too . his pursuit of may is the film . as in luna works such as " lulu " and " jamon ! jamon ! " , the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale . the usual suspects will be offended , but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast . josé luis alcaine ' s images are gorgeous and nicola piovani ' s score is sweet and rich . a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally . 
POS when i was a kid i watched this many times over , and i remember whistling the " happy cat " song quite often . all the songs are great , and actually memorable , unlike many children ' s musicals , where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason . the scenes and costumes are lavish , and the acting is very well - done , which isn ' t surprising , considering the cast . christopher walken is very catlike , and doesn ' t need stupid make - up , or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he ' s a cat transformed to a human . and jason connery ' s so cute , as the shy and awkward miller ' s son , corin , who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera . this is a really fun , enjoyable , feature - length movie , where unlike most fairytales , the characters are given personalities . some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he ' s drowning ; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance , as it ' s " all the rage abroad " ; when walken is in the kitchen , dancing on the table ( he ' s a pretty good dancer , too ! ) ; and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young , like pretending she was a miller ' s daughter . i ' d recommend this film to children and parents alike , who love magic and fairytales . and it actually is a movie you can watch together , as it won ' t drive adults up the wall . 
POS this 1998 film was based on a script by the late edward d . wood , a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief . while much of wood ' s work was quirky low - budget entries into various genre - film traditions , his first released feature glen or glenda was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant - garde techniques . i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood , the experimenter , although this film is a comedy ( a nightmarish comedy , however ! ) , while the cross - dressing theme of glen or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there . from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world , and i can ' t really compare that world with anything else . the technical side of the film - - production design , sound design , music scoring , photography , etc . - - is groundbreaking on any number of levels . in particular , although the film has no " dialogue " there is sound of all kinds and also " language " , but you ' ll have to see how it ' s done yourself , as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout . the glen or glenda - esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum . the whole film is played at a hysterical fever - pitch , and billy zane provides an amazing tour - de - force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is . in a just world , he would have been given some award for this performance . he even looks like ed wood , and as played by zane this character is at various timesfunny , sleazy , tragic , sympathetic , and anonymous ( sometimes simultaneously ! ! ! ) . what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release , only playing a few festivals . right now , it ' s only available on video in germany ( in fact , my copy is from a german source - - the excerpts from wood ' s screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german , although the newspaper headlines ( that great low - budget technique of giving plot elements , especially those that would be too expensive to film , via newspaper headlines is used here in the wood tradition ) that zane sees are in english ) . i think that this film could have gotten a word - of - mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion . and if played off city by city slowing on the art - film circuit , it could have done well . in fact , if the legal issues can be resolved , i ' d like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release , especially a midnight " cult " release . this is a classic waiting to be discovered . < br / > < br / > did i " understand " every scene ? no , but i " felt " every scene emotionally . did everything " work " in the film ? perhaps not . i ' ve only seen it twice , and the first time i saw it i was interruped a number of times . however , with all the assembly - line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much " alternative " film being fetishistic or pretentious shot - on - video film - school rejects , we need actual hollywood - made experimentation like this . the recent bob dylan film " masked and anonymous " took similar chances as did something like steven soderbergh ' s full frontal . this film could find an audience much larger than either of those . if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing , see if it has ever been released on video . you will not be bored . invite some friends over . . . make it a party . play the amazing soundtrack loud . i have a feeling that , wherever he is in the afterlife , ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film . wood ' s probably also laughing that , just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life , the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making . 
POS cor blimey . this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece . billy zane is stunning as the central character , and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy . < br / > < br / > the soundtrack is really good , and the set pieces are a joy to behold . i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates , a few bottles of your liquor of choice , and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained . < br / > < br / > this carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true " b " movie tradition . but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film . ron pearlman for example . i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style . all a bit mad , and all the better for it . 
POS last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made - capote and infamous . < br / > < br / > i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 . a stark , powerful and chillingly brutal drama ; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks ( elmer gantry , cat on a hot tin roof , the professional , blackboard jungle ) . < br / > < br / > it is interesting that robert blake , who starred in this film , has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film . < br / > < br / > this is a film that stays with you after viewing . 
POS i voted excellent for how well the acting was , not for the content . it still gives me chills after reading the book , then watching the movie . two ex - cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison . during the ride , the tension begins to mount , as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation . after the killers are done with their work at the farm , the following morning the family ' s remains are found by the daughter ' s church friend . the blood - curdling scream , as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord , really made my blood run cold and gave me chills . that the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family . robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith . the book was also excellently written by truman capote . 
POS tremendous black - - and - white nighttime cinematography , and plenty of it , highlights this supposedly - true life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men . < br / > < br / > the story was written by truman capote , so you get the very liberal anti - death penalty message at the end of the film , which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case . robert blake and scott wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family . < br / > < br / > despite the annoying slant at the end , this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating . famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this . it makes me wish more modern - day films were made in black - and - white . see it on dvd . < br / > < br / > blake , wilson , john forsythe , jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here . my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 , shortly after blake , in real life , was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife . one can ' t help but look at blake and this film differently after that . 
POS this is one of my favorite movies of all time . i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise . this movie is in some ways similar , but makes rain man seem artificial , shallow , unemotional , and trivial by comparison . 
POS i really love this movie , saw it again last week after 3 years or so . this movie is perfect , great acting , great story , great directing / camera - work / music . it is a gift to show it to someone you love . too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one . top 5 work . really ! ! < br / > < br / > today , it ' s 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above . it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines . anyway , i saw " le huitieme jour " again yesterday . this is with no doubt in my movie top 3 . together with " cinema paradiso " which is also a masterpiece . the soundtrack is also really good . i am really curious about " jaco von dormael ' s " new movie . i hope it will complete my movie top 3 . if you see this movie , rent it . or even better . buy it . because you will want to see it again . 
POS watching david & bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school . despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining . the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for . peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba , susan hayward . raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance . look for the silent screen star francis x . bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer . hooray for the old testament and hollywood . 
POS great movie - i loved it . great editing and use of the soundtrack . captures the real feeling of indian life , yet we can all relate . a well chose cast with some great characters . the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them . the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural . you just can ' t help but to root for jess in this film ! the acting was really good , even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer . 
POS despite louis b . mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract , this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful . it ' s obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings , as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you ' d expect from the best pictures the studio could produce . it simply looks beautiful - - even 84 years later . < br / > < br / > as for garbo herself , like her other very early american films she , too , looks different . while she ' s quite recognizable , her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later - - giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didn ' t see in subsequent films . i kind of wish they ' d kept this look , but considering how famous she ' d become with the trademark look , who am i to say they shouldn ' t have gone that route ? ! the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord . while the landlady , the much esteemed doña bernarda , claims it ' s because the bank has demanded payment , it ' s because her son has fallen for garbo - - and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets ! nice lady , huh ? ! years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world - famous . when she returns to her hometown years later , her old boyfriend ( who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother , doña bernarda , refused to allow it ) sees her . his new love for another lady is now tested - - will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame ? and , more importantly , will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly ? in the meantime , a huge rainstorm hits . the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge . cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks ! in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream , he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying . she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes . then , he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe . she tells him to get lost ! next , you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice , the daughter of the pork king . he obviously has little enthusiasm for this - - and you feel sorry for the lady , as she did nothing wrong . soon , cortez is seen wandering back to garbo ' s home - - he ' s love - sick and needs her . in this scene , garbo is quite luminous and can ' t tell him to leave - - as they dissolve in each other ' s arms . once again , he tells her of his love for her . < br / > < br / > when doña bernarda learns of this , she is not pleased . evidently , a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer . because of the meddling of this nasty old lady , garbo leaves - - unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son . but , cortez comes running - - announcing he must have her and won ' t rest until he has her as his wife . moments after making this proclamation , a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation . so much for " won ' t rest until he has her for his wife " , huh ? ! despite cortez being a wimp through and through , for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him . and so , he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life . when years later garbo meets cortez again , he is a dull looking middle - aged man - - while she is as beautiful as ever . and , not surprisingly , she tells him , once again , to get lost . < br / > < br / > at the time this film was made , garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was . so , in light of this , it ' s surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play . instead of the usual confident valentino - like role they ' d been giving him , here he is an indecisive wimp - - a huge wimp . and , from here on , his career was on a slow downward spiral . as for garbo , the role helped establish her as a big star - - as she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas . < br / > < br / > as for the film , the new music composed for it was very nice , though a tad repetitive . the print , oddly , was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cards - - which could use some restoration . < br / > < br / > a most enjoyable film - - expertly constructed , wistful and worth seeing . and , for one of the few times i can think of it , i have no real complaints in this excellent film . 
POS this is undeniably the scariest game i ' ve ever played . it ' s not the average shoot - everything - that - moves kind of fps ( which i usually don ' t care much for ) , but the acceptable gfx , interesting weapons and magic , great surround soundeffects ( " scryeeee , scryeeee . . " ) and above all incredible atmosphere . i love the scrye , which enables you , at certain places in the games , to see or hear events that happened there in the past . the only game i ' ve had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere . i ' m a great horror fan , escpecially of clive barker ' s stories and movies , and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story . 9 / 10 ( - 1 because i ' m no fps fan , and perhaps the game was a bit short ? ) 
POS very intelligent humor excellent performing i can ' t believe how people could think it deserves a 1 / 10 ! i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity , watch it . . . don ' t miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing " happy birthday " and " el payaso plinplin " ( an argentinian song for kids ( i think . . . it could also be south american , i ' m not sure ) ) . this two songs that have the same melody . . . but people don ' t usually realize that . . . it ' s just grate ! i tried to write this in both spanish and english , because it ' s an argentinian movie . . . but the page wouldn ' t allow me : ( hope you enjoy it ! 
POS edmund burke said that " all evil needs is for good me to do nothing . " hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films . this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith . it had no violence , no lewdness , and did not deserve a pg rating . the western scenery was filmed well , and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking . actors were a bit young for their parts , but otherwise believable and talented . music score was too loud , and in some places drowned out the dialog completely . i ' m seldom surprised by movie endings any more , but i was pleasantly surprised by this one . sometimes the good guys do win , and they win by honest efforts . we liked the movie and the message , and would recommend it for the entire family . 
POS there are some films that every horror fan owes himself ( or herself ) to see , and emilio miraglia ' s " la dama rossa uccide sette volte " aka . " the red queen kills seven times " ( 1972 ) is definitely one of them . with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite sub - genres in horror , i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while , and even though my expectations were high , this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes . miraglia ' s earlier giallo , " the night evelyn came out of the grave " ( 1971 ) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror , but it couldn ' t possibly compare to this instant personal favorite . " the red queen kills seven times " is , hands down , one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made , and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it . an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements , " the red queen " delivers everything one could hope for in either sub - genre : an inventive and incredibly compelling plot , spine - chilling suspense , a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere , eerily lush colors , stylish murders , a brilliant score , and , not least , a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror . < br / > < br / > the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany . as little girls , kitty wildenbrück and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting : legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people . fourteen years later , kitty ( barbara bouchet ) has become a successful fashion photographer . suddenly , people begin to get murdered . . . director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style , atmosphere and colorful creepiness with " the night evelyn came out of the grave " and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem . " the red queen kills seven times " is a feast for the eyes indeed , and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot - wise . the haunting painting in the grandfather ' s castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps . the red lady ( or red queen , as she is called in the english title ) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo , the spine - chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own . < br / > < br / > a sexy female cast is always appreciated , especially in a giallo , and this one is a prime example for that . the ravishing barbara bouchet ( one of my favorite actresses ) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen , and she is a great actress too . bouchet ' s presence has graded up many italian flicks , among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult - masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year ( 1972 ) : fernando di leo ' s " milano calibro 9 " , lucio fulci ' s giallo - highlight " don ' t torture a duckling " and this unforgettable gem . apart from the wonderful miss bouchet , the film ' s gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning , marina malfatti ( " the night evelyn came out of the grave " ) , and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera . < br / > < br / > as the whole film , the murders are stylish and extremely elegant , yet frightening and macabre , and some of them are quite gory . bruno nicolai ' s mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets , and makes the film ' s intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting . the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings , the tension - level increses with each passing minute . " the red queen . . . " begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second . overall , this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for . " the red queen kills seven times " is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made , and a top - priority for every fan of horror and / or italian cinema to see . 10 / 10 
POS . . . i saw this on cable back in the late 1980 ' s as i was a big wrestling fan since 1986 . i saw this on vhs in a ' for sale ' bin and bought it . < br / > < br / > in 1998 , i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that wouldn ' t understand us , the travel , the heartbreak , etc . ) . henry winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively . a great way to separate himself the fonz character he played on happy days at the time . plus , look at the cast . . . william daniels ( knight rider ) , polly holiday ( alice ) , and wrestlers roddy piper and chavo guerrero sr . if you get a chance , watch it . 
POS well i guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces , but i personally think it is . . . it ' s a very beautiful sweet movie , henry winkler did a great job with his character and it really impressed me . 
POS during eddie murphy ' s stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds . what is said is , , women - do mr rob ( this is a character from saturday night live ) , the man responds with shut up bitch . unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby , this is incorrect , although the post - er said he was there they must have a hearing problem ! despite what the post - er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd - do mr rob ! ! ! ! i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
POS eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life . when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it . to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time . for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar . there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle . if you are not the sort of person who can ' t stand swearing then i wouldn ' t advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5 - 10 seconds . i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best . 
POS eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest . delirious is the best stand - up comedy i ' ve ever seen and it is a must - have for anyone who loves a good laugh ! ! i ' ve watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it - i still have side - splitting fun . this is definitely one for your video library . i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much - that you will miss half of them ! delirious is hilarious ! < br / > < br / > although there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand - up comedy , most of them will seem like second - class citizens . if you have never seen it - get it , watch it - and you will love it ! ! it will make you holler ! ! ! : - ) 
POS if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd , it was probably ' delirious ' you were looking for . how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines ? i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time , and when i was old enough to see eddie murphy ' s ' delirious ' and ' raw ' ( not as funny ) i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration . now that i ' m older , and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy , i realize two things : everybody steals from eddie , while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard . that ' s the huge difference : eddie was original , funny , provocative , thoughtful  and more . he was something never before seen . he was all we ever needed . these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king , and ' delirious ' was the greatest castle ever built . truly one of the funniest routines of all time . 
POS judy davis shows us here why she is one of australia ' s most respected and loved actors - her portrayal of a lonely , directionless nomad is first - rate . a teenaged claudia karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country ' s most popular actors in years to come , with future roles in the big steal , the heartbreak kid , dating the enemy , risk and the acclaimed tv series the secret life of us . ( incidentally , karvan , as a child , was a young girl whose toy panda was stolen outside a chemist ' s shop in the 1983 drama going down with tracey mann . ) if this films comes your way , make sure you see it ! ! rating : 79 / 100 . see also : hotel sorrento , radiance , vacant possession , lantana . 
POS well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by trey parker and matt stone of south park fame . however as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly . from the subtle gestures towards a joke , to the blatant toilet humour throughout , along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo . this film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face , let alone his poker underwear . some of the funniest blink and you ' ll miss it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood , along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain . < br / > < br / > i just goes to show that not only is trey parker adept at writing he ' s not too shabby at the old acting game either . i was surprised with the amount that i was absorbed in this film . however i ' m quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet , here in the uk . sort it out boys ! < br / > < br / > i am , and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits , and occasionally snorting into my lager . all in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy . however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear ! however i ' m sure the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and jasmine bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices . 
POS i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen ! it ' s witty humour made me giggle all the way through , and the fact that trey and matt are so over the top , boosts the film ' s comedy . < br / > < br / > i have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it . i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout . the humorous quotes are memorable , and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later . . < br / > < br / > so overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see , especially if you ' re younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards . < br / > < br / > p . s does anybody think its weird for me to like them both ? hehe 
POS whereas the hard - boiled detective stories of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern american genre and style in the process - those of what might be called golden age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever . the problem with books like those of agatha christie , dorothy l . sayers or s . s . van dine ( on whose work this film is based ) , is that they are low on action or variety - whereas sam spade or philip marlowe traverse the mean streets of la , working class tenements , bars , offices , wealthy mansions , and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence , golden age fiction is generally fixed in location , the scene of the murder , usually a lavish country house , and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects . this is a very static procedure , plot reduced to puzzle . < br / > < br / > this , of course , is as much ideological as anything else , the golden age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement ; the hard - boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre ( both of authority , and of a city ) , dividing itself up into hostile , ever uncontrollable and lawless camps . another major problem with golden age fiction is character - because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end , we cannot gain access to characters ' motivations or emotions , being defined solely by their potential need to murder . the detective , unlike the anxious , prejudice - ridden private eyes , are simply there to be brilliant , and maybe a little eccentric . < br / > < br / > the problem with most films from golden age books is that they try to be period recreations of the merchant ivory / jane austen school , and end up looking silly . there have been successes , for example the radical reworkings of ellery queen and others by claude chabrol . in the english - speaking world , there have really only been two . the alistair sim classic , ' green for danger ' , works because it pushes the form almost into parody , while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery . < br / > < br / > before that came michael curtiz ' s brilliant ' the kennel murder case ' . the narrative is pure golden age . a repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him . he is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner , indicating suicide , slumped in a locked room . the caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait . it is up to philo vance , gentleman and amateur detective , neither old nor fat , to read the clues more insightfully , open the case out of the confines of the room , and eventually solve the case , the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation . < br / > < br / > what is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining , and full of comical bits of business . there isn ' t even really an attempt to ' subvert ' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect , with no protest from vance , but that ' s about it . < br / > < br / > what marks ' kennel ' as a classic is its modernity . curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur , because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development . but he was hollywood ' s greatest craftsman , and he is on sensational form here . if the golden age detective story is mere puzzle , curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme , creating an abstract variation on his source , reducing narrative , character and location to geometry , a series of lines , from the beautiful art - deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition , and , as they glide furiously at an angle , jolt the dead decor to life . < br / > < br / > this treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism , it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors , like the two central brothers , or the original crime itself , borrowed from an ' unsolved mysteries ' book . this fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect oriental relics ( shades of ' the moonstone ' ? ) , inscrutable chinese servants , ex - cons turned butlers , dog - loving fops , runyonesque cops , is the perfect habitat for vance , a man who will drop a cruise to europe on a fanciful hunch , who knows the social world of these people , and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police , or would be if he wasn ' t anything more than a thinking machine , william powell , the greatest american comedian of the decade , bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity . < br / > < br / > but if the treatment is rarefied , the climax is spectacularly brutal , involving vicious dogs and attempted murder . the police and the detective , supposed to be preventing crime , are guilty of inciting one . 
POS if you love the thin man series , you will love this movie . powell ' s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles . there are even dogs . . . < br / > < br / > the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy , but it isn ' t half bad . 
POS it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film , whereas ` patton - lust for glory ' , producer frank mccarthy ' s earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war , has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments . like a previous reviewer , i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other . < br / > < br / > one difference between the two films is that ` patton ' is more focused , concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war , whereas ` macarthur ' covers not only this war but also its subject ' s role in the korean war , as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude . < br / > < br / > the main difference , however , lies in the way the two leaders are played . gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c . scott dominated ` patton ' . whereas scott had another major star , karl malden , playing opposite him as general bradley , none of the other actors in ` macarthur ' are household names , at least for their film work . scott , of course , portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery - tempered , a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race , not just with the enemy . i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton , but that is not how he appears in this film . peck ' s macarthur is of a more reflective , thoughtful bent , comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films . at times , he even seems to be a man of the political left . much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid - up member of cnd , and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi - socialist air to them . in an attempt to show something of macarthur ' s gift for inspiring leadership , peck makes him a fine speaker , but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart . it is as if atticus finch from ` to kill a mockingbird ' had put on a general ' s uniform . < br / > < br / > whereas scott attempted a ` warts and all ' portrait of patton , the criticism has been made that ` macarthur ' attempts to gloss over some of its subject ' s less attractive qualities . i think that this criticism is a fair one , particularly as far as the korean war is concerned . the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering , militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp . many historians , of course , feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter ' s conduct was becoming a risk to world peace , and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated . even during the korean scenes , peck ' s macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real - life original probably was ; we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters . ( truman ' s remark ` he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday ' was said about eisenhower , but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur ' s approach to international diplomacy ) . perhaps the film ' s attempt to paint out some of macarthur ' s warts reflects the period in which it was made . the late seventies , after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate , was a difficult time for america , and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation . another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools . if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur , something should have been shown of his early life , which is not covered at all . ( the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines ) . one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur ' s father , himself a military hero . i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was , and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model . another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur ' s clash with truman , with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them . the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches . < br / > < br / > it would be wrong , however , to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether . although i may not have agreed with peck ' s interpretation of the main role , there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness . the film as a whole is a good example of a solid , workmanlike biopic , thoughtful and informative . it is a good film , but one that could have been a better one . 7 / 10 . < br / > < br / > on a pedantic note , the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz , the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war . ( the pre - war boundary was the 38th parallel ) . also , i think that macarthur was referring to the ` tocsin ' of war . war may be toxic , but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin . 
POS demonicus is a movie turned into a video game ! i just love the story and the things that goes on in the film . it is a b - film ofcourse but that doesn ` t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad ! horror and sword fight freaks , buy this movie now ! 
POS panic delivers the goods ten fold with oscar caliber performances from william h macy , neve campbell , and donald sutherland . in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with . chillingly honest and thought provoking , panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years . the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater . 
POS i loved this movie . i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series . i found it very heart warming to see adam west , burt ward , frank gorshin , and julie newmar all back together once again . anyone who loved the batman series from the 60 ' s should have enjoyed return to the batcave . you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film , especially adam west . and i ' ll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so . i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it . . . now they wished they had . i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs . now this movie will join my collection . thank you for the reunion adam and burt . 
POS i ' m a belgian and grew up in the sixties . most of the us series were shown over here ( original language with subtitles ) and batman was one of the first i was keen on . unfortunately over here it caused a " panic hysteria " amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent . geez , compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays . so because of my the over - protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards ( still got them ! ) to compensate . i even got the view master slides . . . i had an urge to see the caped crusader . all kids need some kind of hero . < br / > < br / > years later i finally got the chance to see the re - runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously . the tongue - in - cheek acting would have escaped me when i would ' ve watched it as a kid , but i understood it at the age of 17 . yeah , i ' ve watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven ' t released the series on dvd ( to my knowledge ) < br / > < br / > this evening i enjoyed " return to the bat cave " . . . it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside - jokes . to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect . they play themselves as they played their parts in the series . < br / > < br / > congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic " feast " . . . i ' m gonna watch it again . my advice to all batman fans is : see it ! ! ! rent it ! ! ! lend it from a friend ! ! ! buy it ! ! ! i ' d never expect myself to rate this as 9 / 10 . . . very well done ! 
POS this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference . kyoko is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan . ken is a japanese american manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner . kyoko " marries " ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the u . s . , with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a " green card " the marriage will be in name only . it soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same " time zone " , hence the title of the movie . as an immigration attorney i have seen such " arrangements " take on a life of their own , so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation . 
POS this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made . it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly ' s going on . the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers , commercials , contests one enters by mail , and a host of other innovations . besides , what other movies have cameos by martin luther king , jr ? to decipher the film , hunt down the director ' s book entitled i was curious . it ' ll all become clear . it ' s a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking . a triumph . now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color * other * than white . . . the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible . 
POS i am curious ( yellow ) ( a film , in near seussical rhyme , is said right at the start to be available in two versions , yellow and blue ) was one of those big art - house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal / cause - celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court . what ' s potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what ' s revealed in the sex or nudity - the director / " actor " vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it ' s always more - so an intellectual expression than very lust - like - but the daring of the attempt at a pure ' metafilm ' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden . who knew such things in a generally peaceful country ( i . e . usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars ) could be so heated - up politically ? at least , that ' s part of sjoman ' s aim here . < br / > < br / > like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w . r . ( if not as surreal and deranged ) or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci , sjoman is out to mix politics and sex ( mostly politics and social strata ) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film . the two characters , lena and borje , have a hot - cold relationship in the story of the film , where lena is a " curious " socialist - wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and ' trains ' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one , while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend . and as this is going on , which is by itself enough for one movie , sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film ( there ' s even a great bit midway through where , as if at a rock concert , title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are , negating having to use end credits ! ) then with this there ' s a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance , not just a " hey , i ' m the director playing the director " bit . < br / > < br / > at first , one might not get this structure and that i am curious ( yellow ) is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class , socialism , spain and franco , and once in a while we see lena ' s father or bjore . but sjoman does something interesting : the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes ; it ' s impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative , documentary , film - within - a - film , and even a serious interview with martin luther king , who also acts as a quasi - guru for lena . it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically , but it doesn ' t feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture ; the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength . his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer . < br / > < br / > if i am curious ( yellow ) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full - blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors , it isn ' t entirely successful , i think , as an emotional experience . where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies , sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors . occasionally it works if only for the actors , lena nyman ( mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even ) and borje ahlstedt ( a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena ) , but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner - film of lena and borje since ( perhaps intentionally ) sjoman fills it up with clichés ( borje has a girlfriend and kid , will he leave her , how will lena reconcile her father ) and a heavy - handed narration from his starlet of sorts . < br / > < br / > and yet , for whatever faults sjoman may have , ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself , i am curious ( yellow ) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema , or testing what couldn ' t be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage . i ' d even go as far as to say it ' s influential , and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time ( a specific technique used , with the film rewinding towards the end , is echoed in poorer usage in funny games ) , and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant - garde or meta - film - making . if it ' s not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w . r . or last tango , it ' s close behind . 
POS excellent movie , a realistic picture of contemporary finland , touching and profound . one of the best finnish films ever made . captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town , people ' s desires and weaknesses , joys and sorrows . the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society . lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers . he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed . his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki . 
POS nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love . this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathis ' s song , or any song from that era : bobby darin ' s , beyond the sea . . . or stan getz ' s , the girl from ipanema , et al . . . < br / > < br / > i measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i ' m satisfied . . . chances are had me back a few good times . < br / > < br / > i also watch the synergy between the cast . . . i thought they worked well together . < br / > < br / > open your heart , and let the comedic magic of film transport you . < br / > < br / > ' alan 
POS i ' m glad that this is available on dvd now . this film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty - headed flashing lights & constant loud noises . < br / > < br / > essentially , if you have a short attention span or lack the wit & imagination to engage with literary narrative you won ' t like this film . the reasons for this are quite simple , but unfortunately rarely achieved : matthew jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of catherine storr ' s novel ' marianne dreams ' successfully to a screenplay . an unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know . < br / > < br / > the casting is excellent , allowing director bernard rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now ; they indulge in the craft of acting ! i know , i know , actors doing their job & acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases , explosions & fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat , but it does actually happen in this film . < br / > < br / > this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker & not the spoon - fed tabloid reader - apart from a solid script , direction & acting , it relies on atmosphere , suspense & implied horror . if it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of ' paper house ' is more in the vein of sophocles than tobe hooper . < br / > < br / > in conclusion then , if you like lots of loud noises , explosions , constant cuts , & bright flashing colours you ' d be better off watching ' transformers ' , but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful & evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing . 
POS let us begin by saying that this film ' s english title " the power of kangwon province " is an absolute misnomer . it is because in hong sang soo ' s film , there are no actual shots of wars , troubles and conflicts . so the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film . if we were to judge this film by its korean language title , " kangwon - do ui him " is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest . hong sang soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives . the people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods , whims and fancies . if making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker ' s meritorious virtue then hong sang soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships , sentiments and lives . whether one likes it or not , this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film . 
POS fever pitch is a fun enough movie . it has a lot of funny moments ( including a hilariously disturbing shower scene ) . like most romantic comedies , it has a " dead zone " in the middle where all the heavy , " she ' s breaking up with me " stuff happens , but other than that it continues to be funny until the end . < br / > < br / > even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox , it ' s not overloaded with sports . you don ' t have to be a fan to enjoy this film . < br / > < br / > of course that ' s easy for me to say : i ' ve been a red sox fan since i was a boy , too . < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 . < br / > < br / > barky 
POS ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors . my parents and i watched together " c ' eravamo tanto amati " on a summer night : we liked it , but we didn ' t love it as we loved " a special day " . i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated : we often forget to remember him , maybe because his latest films were disappointing . and so , yesterday night , my mum and i sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece . writing , direction , cinematography , score and production design were sober and accurate , but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni . they ' re both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele . antonietta is an housewife : married with a fanatic fascist , she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families . gabriele is simply an anti - fascist . they spend together a special day , that special day of 1938 when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini . i don ' t want to spoil anymore about the plot : go looking for this film ! 
POS while rome goes mad celebrating hitler ' s visit - uniforms , bands , parades - two outsiders stay home , in a large building , and wind up meeting . she is sofia loren , who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children . he is mastroianni , a radio speaker who ' s been fired because of his homosexuality . both of them need company and understanding , both f them find it in each other . < br / > < br / > the movie covers a span of a few hours . the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers . strangely enough , the nazi anthem - the horst - wessel - lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme . < br / > < br / > beautiful movie , excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching , sad story . mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job , very far away from her usual truck driver ' s pin - up , neapolitan fishwife personas . don ' t miss it . 
POS first of all for this movie i just have one word : ' wow ' . this is probably , one of the best movies that touched me , from it ' s story to it ' s performances , so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni . i was very impressed with this last one , because he really brought depth to the character , as it was a very hard role . still , the two of them formed a pair , that surprised me , from the beginning until the end , showing in the way , a friendship filled with love , that develops during the entire day , settled in the movie . the story takes some time to roll , as the introduction of the characters is long , but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity . if you have the chance , see it , because it ' s a movie that will stay in your mind for many time . simply amazing - 9 / 10 . 
POS in this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies . this is amusing at first , but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances , how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable . < br / > < br / > characters often interact in a peculiar way , with no tact or manners or respect . i believe this is intentional , not bad acting . after all , who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city ' s inhabitants behave like that . < br / > < br / > i didn ' t like most of the action scenes , apart the death of the priest : too cheap even for the seventies . the plot isn ' t too polished . but the great scenes and ideas - like the death of sol , the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with , the " furniture " - outweigh the shortcomings of this film . < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10 . 
POS the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach . both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms . on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet . < br / > < br / > maybe there ' s cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven ' t reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now . new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green . environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming . for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck . obviously there ' s no family planning in this world either . < br / > < br / > charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g . robinson who ' s old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck . there ' s been a murder committed , joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation , a multi - national concern that has come up with a food product , some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world ' s population . it ' s latest product is soylent green . < br / > < br / > the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man , but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind . as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people , that we ' ve become a race of cannibals , the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative . we ' ve exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive . < br / > < br / > this was the farewell performance of edward g . robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views . a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia , he passed away in real life . not many did , but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them . < br / > < br / > though the timetable was off , it doesn ' t mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass . hopefully we ' ll have not just the intelligence , but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening . 
POS tachigui : the amazing lives of the fast - food grifters japanese title : tachiguishi retsuden < br / > < br / > director : mamoru oshii featuring : toshio suzuki , mako hyodo , kenji kawai , shinji higuchi , katsuya terada narrated by koichi yamadera - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - < br / > < br / > way back in 1995 , mamoru oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature ghost in the shell , which helped consolidate anime ' s international acceptance - and also burrowed itself into andy and larry wachowski ' s overall concept for the matrix . < br / > < br / > the movie ' s sequel , innocence ( 2004 ) , was the inaugural japanese animated film to compete for the palme d ' or at cannes , and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its oft unfathomable plot . < br / > < br / > always the trendsetter , oshii has now presented us with tachigui : the amazing lives of the fast - food grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with ghost in the shell , nor japanese anime for that matter . < br / > < br / > say hello to oshii ' s creation " superlivemation " : not quite animation , nor exactly live - action . instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of 30 , 000 snapshots , which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut - out fashion reminiscent of balinese puppetry . the movement itself is a stilted , stop - motion style that echoes sequences from shinya tsukamoto ' s experimental tetsuo : iron man ( 1988 ) . < br / > < br / > " i couldn ' t think of any method but this one , " said oshii in a recent interview with the daily yomiuri . " i realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation . " < br / > < br / > the cast choice is equally enigmatic . kenji kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic , while renowned studio ghibli producer toshio suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion . others include katsuya terada , who dabbled with oshii on blood : the last vampire , and shinji higuchi - a special effects whiz who ' s worked on godzilla movies . < br / > < br / > koichi yamadera ' s narration sounds like the stuff of a dry nhk documentary  which belies the comic undertone here as well as yamadera ' s extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like spike siegel in cowboy bebop . < br / > < br / > and the plot itself is a bizarre re - imagining of post - wwii japan in the context of various fast - food off - shoots - from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand - up bars ; american dogs in the heat - up trays of convenience stores to mcdonalds - inspired burger - chain restaurants . " food is a primal root of desire , " asserted oshii , by way of explanation . < br / > < br / > thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer : the fast - food grifters of the title , people who don ' t like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine - tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies . < br / > < br / > oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the " art " of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country , and which goes some way toward explaining the use of " tachigui " in the title . < br / > < br / > the director of live - action movies ( avalon , stray dog ) as well as animation , oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums . the celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats . < br / > < br / > at times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating . just don ' t ask what it ' s all really supposed to mean ; oshii ' s films , which are equal parts cerebral and innovative , are often not particularly clear story - wise . where oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor  here you ' ll find kentucky fried rat , death by hula - hoop , the world ' s fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movie ' s very nature of surrealism . < br / > < br / > this is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like godard and truffaut , and perhaps owes as much to andrei tarkovsky as he does david lynch . so it shouldn ' t come as any surprise that at one stage a b - 52 bomber does a fly - through in a yoshinoya look - alike franchise . the 54 - year - old writer - director seemed to think this natural . " the japan i depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality , " he suggested . < br / > < br / > of course . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - < br / > < br / > by andrez bergen 
POS call me stupid , but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie , valentine . it was so well - made , well - written , well - acted , well - directed , etc ! everything about it was wonderful ! there were parts that were relatively routine ( lily ' s death ) , very funny ( www . bleed - me - dry . com ) , completely horrifying and creepy ( paige ' s death ) , and just plain heartbreaking ( the first scene ) . i think the entire cast did a great job , especially the three leads : david boreanaz , denise richards ( both of whom i met , and got autographs from , during the filming of this movie - very nice people ! ) , and marley shelton . < br / > < br / > i am very sick of people calling this movie " another scream clone " . this movie is , in no way , a scream clone . in fact , this film runs rings around scream . it actually makes sense ! scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it . excuse me , but it looks like scream was also a clone too ( ahem . . . , friday the 13th , halloween , and many other scary movies also featured masked killers ) . i also think that the novelty of the cupid - masked killer is brilliant . it ' s so strange to see a sweet , cupid face doing all of these horrible things . another novelty ( the nose bleeding ) makes way for a fantastic ending ! the ending gives me chills every time i see it ! ! ! ! ! so , even if you didn ' t like it the first time , watch valentine again and give it another chance ! < br / > < br / > ps - keep an eye out for my new website ( www . love - hurts . org ) ! coming soon . . . 
POS this film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years . it is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary - not contrived but very real . it is very interesting and unsettling 
POS i just saw " valentine " and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i ' ve seen in years . unlike the recent trend of 90 ' s horror flicks , this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self - mocking . for those out there that hated " scream , " there is not one reference to " the horror rules " in this movie ( even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here ) . < br / > < br / > this is the perfect blend of 80 ' s and 90 ' s horror . you get the style , cinematography , and good acting of 90 ' s films and the stalking - slasher madness of an 80 ' s flick . i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for . this is definitely a move in the right direction . < br / > < br / > denise richards stands out here as a fun character . you can tell she liked her role , and that makes her stand out . i loved her in this movie . 
POS scott henderson ( alan curtis ) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife . the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name . after accused of the murder , the police visit all the places he had been with her , but people only remember him being alone . he ' s sentenced to die and his secretary ( ella raines ) sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him . < br / > < br / > this was made as a b film from universal ( look at the cast - - all character actors and one star - - franchot tone - - on the decline ) . the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s . it ' s beautifully directed by curt siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish ( a pen name for cornell woolrich ) . it moves quickly and just looks fantastic . and there ' s the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr . which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy ( i ' m surprised the censors didn ' t cut it ) . < br / > < br / > there are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect . tone gives a dreadful performance . he looks ghastly and he ' s just horrible . also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson . you really wonder why raines loves him - - he ' s so unemotional . but raines is pretty good in the lead role . she ' s pretty and full of life . also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true . he ' s hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstated . < br / > < br / > still i ' m giving this a 9 . a really great film - - flaws aside . 
POS ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60 ' s world . the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional . i got this game april 2007 ( two years after release ) , and i am still impressed with the gameplay . it ' s a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games . < br / > < br / > i give this game 10 / 10 for the levels it contains , especially the " consulate " level . i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over . the only thing i didn ' t like in the game is the russian boat level , it was too much pressure . on the whole i like the game a lot ! ! 
POS this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because : < br / > < br / > the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good . the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play . the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie . the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game . also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool . < br / > < br / > overall score * * * * * * * * * * out of * * * * * * * * * * 
POS guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever . it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more . it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals - musicals were made to entertain , not to to preach . nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached . the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando , the guy can ' t sing ! it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i couldn ' t understand him . if it weren ' t for marlon i would have given this 10 stars . guys and dolls provides old - fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days . watch it to have a good time ! ! 
POS i thought it was an original story , very nicely told . i think all you people are expecting too much . i mean . . . it ' s just a made for television movie ! what are you expecting ? some great wonderful dramtic piece ? i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie . . . . and that ' s my opinion . 
POS i don ' t think a movie like this would be released today . it takes it ' s time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn ' t full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat . < br / > < br / > but , what this film does have : an interesting study in how families ' deal with grief . how when the language for healing and over - coming tremendous loss leaves us mute , and we rely on raw emotions instead . grief without reason and patience is anger , even hate . and unfortunately , the lead character ( a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting ) in the film is given more than his fair share of it . he eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather ( wilford brimley ) who makes it clear to him that it was an accident . i got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart , but needed to hear those words from his parents , and to receive their forgiveness . < br / > < br / > what i loved about this film : the lack of dialog . there was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction , facial expressions . and the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors . something we don ' t get to do alot of with today ' s films . < br / > < br / > 
POS excellent story about teenagers , leaders , high school football " stars " . how far will you go to protect your friends ? lie , kill ? how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl ? can love beat the odds ? can you defeat narrow - minded small town people ? when your friend scores and you " lose " , will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it , or will you be a man about it , and respect her right to chose ? will you rape her and show it as your victory over a " problem " girl ? can you stand by the one who ' s only sin is to have an opinion of her own , to be able to make her own decisions , to chose for herself ? it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong , but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general . thumb up ! 
POS i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago . i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me . she fought alone is about a girl , caitlin ( played by tiffani thiessen ) , who is raped by jace ( played by david lipper ) , a classmate who enjoys hurting girls . caitlin is in a popular high school clique , but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her , led by ethan ( played by brian austin green ) . < br / > < br / > this movie chronicles caitlin ' s struggle against an entire town , including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment , allowing them to get away with whatever they wish . < br / > < br / > thiessen and green are the top performers , and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film . all of the actors in this film , which was inspired by actual events , did a great job . she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school ( at least in 1995 ) , and having one ' s self - esteem and reputation at stake . recommended . 10 / 10 
POS michelle rodriguez plays diana , a high school girl with an insolent scowl and 2 x 4 on her shoulder . she ' s ready to battle anyone , especially her father who is paying for her brother ' s boxing lessons . diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her anger . < br / > < br / > i liked the relationship between diana and adrian . santiago douglas as adrian is excellent . watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle . 
POS girlfight is like your grandmother ' s cooking : same old recipe you ' ve tried a million times before , yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new . try and explain the story to people who haven ' t seen it before : a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter , obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival . watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés , and they ' re right : it * is * clichéd . yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works , due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue , and sensitive direction that makes it ' new ' . i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but don ' t make the same mistake i did . definiately worth a look . 
POS casting unknown michelle rodriguez as diana was a stroke of genius . she ' s perfect . her acting inexperience actually works in her favor . we ' ve never seen her before so it really feels like her story . she also brings across genuine toughness . this works against her though , because we never doubt her . you never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don ' t think she can beat . so as a boxing movie , it fails . < br / > < br / > then again , this isn ' t really a boxing movie . how do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn ' t a boxing movie ? you don ' t . but karyn kusama has anyway . like many indie films , " girlfight " defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life . < br / > < br / > diana is doing poorly in school . she beats up people she doesn ' t like ( all the other girls in her school for example ) . she doesn ' t fit in . her father is forcing her kid brother tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough . he gives tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives diana nothing , as if she has no need to defend herself , nor anything worthwhile to make of her life . tiny wants to go to art school ( cliche ' , yuck ) , so he gives up his boxing allowance to diana , who actually wants to box . things get complicated when diana falls for another boxer , adrian ( santiago douglas ) , who ' s looking to turn pro . from there the story winds down toward the inevitable . . . the two meet in the amateur title fight . < br / > < br / > what left me cold was that i never found any of this all that interesting . it ' s all just a bit too believable . kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports . a lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances . the mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing , where anger is your friend . so this time it ' s a girl . big deal . < br / > < br / > or there ' s another position to take : finally , a boxing movie about a girl . women ' s boxing has been around a long time . the brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people ' s their lives and their feelings . the whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture . respect . overcoming adversity . self - discovery . < br / > < br / > i recommend " girlfight " because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director . the dialogue never rises above soap opera quality , but the story itself actually changed my view on some things . yes , the world now seems like a better place . a film did that . < br / > < br / > grade : b - 
POS " girlfight " follows a project dwelling new york high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem , purpose , and much more . although the film is not about boxing , boxing is all about the film . so much so you can almost smell the sweat . technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it , " girlfight " is no chick flick and no " rocky " . it is , rather , a very human drama which even viewers who don ' t know boxing will be able to connect with . 
POS back in 2004 i saw " true " , tom tykwer ' s contribution to paris je t ' aime . when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled . it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much . of course i wanted to watch the whole film , and i would even check who was attached , etc . < br / > < br / > yesterday i finally saw it , courtesy of the internet . < br / > < br / > first of all i must say that it looks awesome . the photography is beautiful in every short and shot , at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear . later i read the trivia here , and maybe it ' s how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dp ' s work . my special favorites are the " quais de seine " first scene ( that sunlight ! ) , the sin city - esquire ( but better for me ) " quartier de la madeleine " , and " 14th arrondisement " - but you know , what the hell i like them all : " true " or " faubourg saint - denis " still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours ( my eyes , they tremble ! ) and " quartier latin " is gold imprisoned on silver . beautiful . < br / > < br / > yes , these are some beautiful short films . < br / > < br / > now let ' s get onto the content . i very much ( and i mean very much ) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt . you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts , and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts . i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy - chinese - musical - in - paris - with - barbet - schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue . i love surprises ! and this film has them ! it ' s great they took a chance to let all these director ' s flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema ( which i have come to heavily despise ) . it ' s not heavily experimental , but i can breath the breathing space these people had . < br / > < br / > i like the small time and i love the acting . i love the simplicity and i love the love . i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it ' s a film that is very very very nice to see , alone or with someone . to simply feel . it left me feeling very good . < br / > < br / > there is something about the earnestness in it . . . it ' s so frank . . . < br / > < br / > what i didn ' t like ? well , for me there are two shorts that aren ' t exactly the best - " quais de seine " ( which is good natured , sure , and maybe even necessary , but feels too much like a commercial ? ) and " père - lachaise " that even though i love the acting , i felt it ' s themes were forced . but that of course , is just me . " tour eiffel " i also didn ' t love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet ? i don ' t know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor ' s and directors , and so they can delight in their interaction , in the surprises ( look out for alexander payne in a funny role ) and basically in " what will this director do with this ? " great question . i enjoyed it very much in that way . < br / > < br / > i repeat now : most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix . i definitely recommend it . definitely ! ! ! so , watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love ! 
POS although cameron grant was clearly hired to replace andrew blake over at ultimate pictures when the latter started his own company ( studio a ) , he practically outdid the " master " right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes . so , while all the window dressing blake had pioneered ( starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses , coiffed and made up as if they ' re about to hit the catwalk ) remained very much present and accounted for , grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content . in doing so , he raised the heat to a level that had eluded big a ever since his first  and imho best  film night trips . cam ' s maiden effort , elements of desire , might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the blake aesthetic ( with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes ) , but his subsequent dinner party already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece . < br / > < br / > the title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories , with an extended orgy at the conclusion . scrumptious juli ashton and tammy parks smear food stuff all over each other ' s flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh . busty crystal gold ( here : " catalina " ) was rarely more than a reliable second - stringer , adding spice to several ona zee bargain basement noirs , yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with fabio lookalike vince voyeur . beautiful blondes kylie ireland and yvonne , making out with marc davis ( for the record , the latter two were an item at the time ) under a waterfall , complete the eye candy section of the movie . < br / > < br / > time to get cooking ! early jenna jameson ( " daisy " back then ) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains frank towers ( " mark slade " on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry ) of all vital juices , albeit with a little help from brunette diva for effective contrast , the scene ' s stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place . impossibly hunky construction worker gerry pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down , a prospect too tantalizing for prim ' n ' proper business woman asia carrera ( at her all time most achingly pretty ) to pass up . best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty norma jeane and handsome sean michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters !  while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion . < br / > < br / > with sex that proves either artsy or hot , and more often than not both , grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film ' s gastronomic analogy the title implies . couples may be the prime intended audience , but an alternation between naughty ' n ' nice should rightfully include that " something for everything " recipe so many adult features are aiming for . acting as his own dop , the director shows great eye for detail , like the shot of asia carrera ' s pristine white shoes being spattered with mud , enriching his vision . this marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one , as was the case with nick steele who stepped up to take his place at ultimate  effectively making him a replacement ' s replacement ?  when he packed up for greener pastures . 
POS robert altman is my favorite american director . i must admit that i have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned : " quintet " , if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown - up and beautiful brigitte fossey , who was unforgettable as the little girl in " forbidden games " ; " health " , for having lauren bacall , carol burnett , alfre woodard and glenda jackson , all in the same cast ; " popeye " , for that splendid and surreal world , shelley duvall ' s olive oyl and the wonderful malta locations ; " o . c . & stiggs " , for its proposal of an anti - " adolescents flick " ; " beyond therapy " , for all its lunacy and for the presence of genèvieve page , who for all her effort to look parisian chic is taken for a travestite . . . i have even enjoyed his one - act tv movies , like " the dumb waiter " and " the laundromat " . when there is not much plot to develop in his films , you have wonderful performances , from burnett , john travolta , kim basinger or jane curtin . i perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the united states . it is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated , and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out american prizes and awards . he is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies . he is more of a maverick . so it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about " the gingerbread man " , his most ' mainstream ' effort to date and to my knowledge . i did not know there were so many people who thought like leonard maltin , who does not like altman at all . in this case , one may dislike " the gingerbread man " , but for me the reason has more to do with grisham than with the director - screenwriter . some of altman ' s trademarks are here : improvised dialogue , great performances , a funny lawyers ' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary . while some people find it boring , i found the first act fascinating , thanks also for the great cinematography by changwei gu , the man who shot " red sorghum " , " ju dou " and " farewell my concubine " . he has a way of showing us the same things we see in other american movies , but under a different light . through his " foreigner ' s gaze " , almost everything seems new and different . in this first act , things were so logical and true ! wait until you get older . you may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as embeth davidtz . i know for myself what i have done fascinated by someone who is younger than i am ! then you have robert duvall ' s repellent , menacing and mysterious character , while that geraldo storm is threatening savannah . the second act gets a little phony and even funny , because altman may have conducted it with a grin . i remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks . i think he was applying a bit of brecht , distancing us , preparing us for the third act , which is plain hollywood pastiche . altman does it with expertise . being a wise man , and an intelligent director , luckily he did not fall into the traps of today ' s action movies . he was directing a tale of lust , greed and death . i was not disappointed a bit with the movie . if i give it a nine instead of 10 , it is because of grisham . the american reader has turned him into a best - selling author . so why complain ? maybe we should thank altman for showing us the seams in his stories , the dullness , the flatness and the silliness of them all . however , he does it with so much gusto and humor , that i cannot but disagree with the negative comments . for me , these persons saw another movie . . . and vice versa . 
POS i had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back . so when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay - for - view channel i was intrigued . i wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for vietnam . i went out and rented this movie and i have to say it is the most heart - wrenching film i have ever seen . i bought the dvd immediately after renting it . the way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something i ' ve never experienced with any other film . as far as vietnam subject films go , i think it is the best one , although platoon runs a close second . besides all of that , i think it is also colin farrell ' s best performance as an actor . i like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible . i gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies . 
POS i really like this movie . bozz is an ultra - cool , not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war . his persona is similar in a way to yossarian in catch - 22 , joseph heller ' s classic novel about men and war . this film , however , is not set in a war zone , but in a pre - war combat prep training . this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause . < br / > < br / > colin farrell is brilliant as bozz , a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him . bozz is totally cool and non - plussed , testing and tweaking his military superiors , getting their goat at every opportunity . he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree , " saving " his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need , the way out of this man ' s army . < br / > < br / > the acting and action is crisp and believable and as a " sleeper " , tigerland goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam films in my opinion . < br / > < br / > five stars , a top pick . 
POS i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s . it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation . i ' m not sure that squares with the facts . < br / > < br / > still the film is well done . the german high command reports wryly without emotion " the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse " as if all went according to plan . < br / > < br / > it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock - off was based on the british historian trevor - roper ' s account by a similar title last days of hitler . i was surprised to see no credit to trevor - roper . < br / > < br / > i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic . the american knock - off was a little flat . < br / > < br / > few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph . yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler ' s double alluded to in passing in john toland ' s magnificent historical piece . < br / > < br / > was gibs ? 
POS okay , i ' ll admit it - - i am a goof - ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy . while i have seen more films by kurosawa , bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet , i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn ' t try to be sophisticated but is simply funny . a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail , uhf , start the revolution without me , strange brew and the bill and ted movies . they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them . < br / > < br / > while bill & ted ' s bogus journey isn ' t as wonderful as the original bill and ted film , it still is great fun . also , unlike the original , it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing . i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it - - possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs . but , every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments - - particularly those involving the grim reaper . and , by the way , this reaper is about as different from bergman ' s in the seventh seal as you can get ! ! in addition to a lot of laughs , this film features some excellent music - - one way that it ' s actually better than the first film . the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes - - provided you aren ' t an old killjoy like de nomolos . great viewing for kids and adults alike . 
POS visual creative epic of inimitable style . < br / > < br / > this film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting . but who dares to say this film is no art ? i ' m not a supporter of the idea , that an important film must be serious , non - commercial or bothering me with questions . even there are a lot of films , apposite to this attributes , that i like . < br / > < br / > bogus journey , for sure , is not one of this films . what you get is pure , excessive creativity with a very positive charged , childlike energy . this film doesn ' t reflect reality . its friendly - naive and utopian . imagine the world of the future described by rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time - place combination to live in ! except of that music ; - ) < br / > < br / > technically , bogus jorney is very well made . i always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie . especially in this point bogus journey tops its prequel by far . also the effects are good , and i think most of them very made without cgi . i generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies . sure its ' just another hollywood movie ' out of some peoples view . but i think it is this in a very charismatic way . < br / > < br / > a short word to the soundtrack : all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film . also the sound design has no lack . i am not a big fan of rock music , but i had to get this track by winger from the scene ' station ' builds the bill and ted robots in the van . i love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning . < br / > < br / > let me conclude saying this : < br / > < br / > this film is very naive and very imaginative ! it is way better than panzerkreuzer potemkin , the godfather , eraserhead or aguirre - the wrath of god . it is absolutely superior to citizen kane , apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil . . . . . . it is even better than total recall . . . no way ! ? yes way ! < br / > < br / > bill and ted ' s bogus journey is simply the best movie ever made . < br / > < br / > who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of " artsie - fartsy behavior " or likes terminator salvation ( what is the bigger self - defamation ) < br / > < br / > ps : part 1 is not the better movie . so bogus jorney is a superior sequel . not even terminator 2 is a superior sequel ! its not ! 
POS i realize that alot of people hate this movie , but i must admit that it is one of my favorites . i happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies . < br / > < br / > first off , i think that people never give the story any credit , much like back to the future , time travel is hard to write , and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey . < br / > < br / > i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie , they looked cooler , acted cooler , and said cooler things . < br / > < br / > the set design of this movie is awsome as well , the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell . . . but isnt that the genius of the whole franchise , making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth . < br / > < br / > the costume design was awsome as well . bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey , where as in excellent adventure they look rather like , well as they would put it , fags ! ! ! < br / > < br / > even the music in this movie is awsome , the score especially . there so much i could say about this film , cause i love it . but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more , so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure ( which i also love by the way ) . < br / > < br / > get down with your bad self ! ! ! ! 
POS 1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol ' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members . < br / > < br / > 11 nominations and not a single title : such was the academy ' s disdain for one of their greatest directors ; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler ' s list , which is , arguably , not as good ( and i ' m half - polish ) . < br / > < br / > don ' t get me wrong , schindler was a classic . and i ' m not knocking ' out of africa ' ( which won that year ) either ; but it was , in my mind , a class behind this one : an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and i ' m not a big cryer . < br / > < br / > maybe it was the music ( superb ) , or the cinematography ( sumptuous ) , but more likely simply the acting : whoopi , who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne ; danny glover , who i ' d never heard of before ; and , of course , oprah . < br / > < br / > the rest is history ; but , at the time : who knew ? 
POS jim mckay has made one of the best films you will see all year . the quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go . there is not one false note in the entire film . not one . everything works . the hand - held camera is never distracting and always where it should be . the three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real . there isn ' t a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role . these are just real girls trying to find themselves . there is no political agenda , hidden or otherwise . this is cinema at its most basic , and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie - goers , it deserves a much wider release . a special hats off to hugh hefner for providing the film - makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made . i can ' t wait to see what mr . mckay does next . 
POS this is a cgi animated film based upon a french 2d animated series . the series ran briefly on cartoon network , but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people i know going " huh ? " this is the story of lian - chu , the kind heart muscle , and gwizdo , the brains of the operation , who along with hector their fire farting dragon , he ' s more like a dog . travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid . into their lives comes zoe , the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind . it seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes . in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater . zoe of course tags along . . . < br / > < br / > what can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock ? this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar contender . its a beautifully designed , fantastic looking film ( the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures ) that constantly had me going " wow " at it . the english voice cast with forrest whitaker as lian - chu ( one of the best vocal performances i ' ve ever heard ) and rob paulson as gwizdo ( think steve bucsemi ) is first rate . equally great is the script which doesn ' t talk down to its audience , using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films ( not disney nor pixar ) . its all really well done . < br / > < br / > is it perfect ? no , some of the bits go on too long , but at the same time its is damn entertaining . < br / > < br / > if you get the chance see this . its one of the better animated films from 2008 , and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009 . 
POS for a long time i haven ' t seen so beautiful animated feature . having healthy respect for pixar , i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by ' em can not be compared to this . animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here . the graphics is amazing , the background surroundings are mind - blowing , almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly . sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i ' ve seen . < br / > < br / > the plot is absolutely romantic . as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be . the characters are lovable , especially hector , the blue rabbit , he owns , pawns , rocks and rules ! the other char - s are very nice also . the humor is top - notch . < br / > < br / > generally it seemed that creators didn ' t invest much effort into this . i mean it looked like it didn ' t take em too much in difference from people of pixar & dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new . and i ' m very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great . they ' ve made a magnificent , touching movie , a candy for eye and heart . < br / > < br / > the only minus is stupid beginning and that ' s why it ' s 9of10 not 10 / 10 
POS corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience , because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie . in a coreen drama such as this " secret sunshine " , you ' ll also find some comical parts , thriller scenes and romantic times . " there ' s not only tragedy in life , there ' s also tragic - comedy " says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by song kang - ho , summing up the mixture of the picture . but don ' t get me wrong , this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with , adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators . that doesn ' t mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary , it ' s rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain . < br / > < br / > shin - ae , who ' s in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband , really gives , by all the different faces of suffering she ' s going through , unity to this movie . it ' s realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through . denial , lost , anger , faith , pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses , and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience . < br / > < br / > the only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience ( the woman wears the mask of tragedy , the man represents the comical interludes ) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you . i must say that some parts of the movie really did move me ( especialy in the beginning ) , particularly those concerning the unability of chang joan to truly help the one he loves , but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end . nevertheless , some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising ( the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing ) . this kind of scenes makes " secret sunshine " the melo equivalent of " the host " for horror movies or " memories of murder " for thrillers . these movies are indeed surprising , most original , aesthetically incredible , and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with . the only thing that " secret sunshine " forgets , as " the host " forgot to be scary , is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama , but good point for a good film . 
POS most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good ( and bad ) sci - fi movies in hollywood . but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land . the story is a basic femme fatale premise , nothing new or enthralling . verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences , which instead of defining our main character and his situation , are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot . the screenplay was solid , the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story . what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting . jereone krabbe was amazing as the " tortured artist " , and the supporters were very good as well . also , jan de bont ' s cinematography adds at least some life to the film , helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director . < br / > < br / > 6 . 5 / 10 < br / > < br / > * * 1 / 2 / * * * * 
POS this movie is light , funny , and beautifully filmed . the lightning is absolutely superb , and the colours convincingly remind vermeer paintings . < br / > < br / > this is sentimental comedy at its best , way above us and french standards , and arguably better than english ones too . < br / > < br / > every character is touching , and interpretation is close to perfection . isabelle blais is splendid , sylvie moreau is better than in the catherine series , stéphane gagnon is charming , emmanuel bilodeau is great in that weird role of his , and geneviève laroche is the perfect best friend ! < br / > < br / > i could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie , so give it a chance , and add your own review . 
POS a typical clausen film , but then again not typical . clausen writes , directs and play one of the leading roles . this is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it . the 4 primary actors were fantastic . < br / > < br / > fritz helmut was convincing . you believe that he really is sick . < br / > < br / > sonja richter plays a nurse that really is an actor , but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man . < br / > < br / > everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy . but nothing good comes easy , they have to fight to win their life and love . 
POS some people loved " the aristocrats " and others hated it , frequently walking out in the middle . reactions to eddie izzard aren ' t likely to be that extreme - - if you can handle a transvestite comedian ( who says he likes girls ) and has a vocabulary that makes , shall we say , enough use of the " f " word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television . many of izzard ' s fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances . on the other hand , i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard ' s chest but also more often than not funny and , in spots , absolutely hilarious . he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines . he ' s not a story teller . he ' s not a joke maker . he ' s not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams . he plays around with ideas , some of which work and some of which - - a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz , for instance - - are completely unfunny . he has a way , however , of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect . i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8 . but a 10 ? no way . 
POS i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh , so i have decided to write my own . i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then . first of all let me say that , overall , the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile . it doesn ' t matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults . it is worth watching . the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman ' s visit a restrictive , narrow - minded anglo - canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis - en - scene . the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people . and in that sense it is exactly accurate . the acting - especially by rip torn ( whitman ) and colm feore as the doctor - is very good . the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time . overall , what ' s not to like ? besides , name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life ? 
POS visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy , this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark , the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced . the special effects are beautiful and imaginative . the plot is a bit on the cerebral side , but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons . if thinking is not your forte , however , this may not be your movie . maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio ' s no brain club , but if you are looking for something more , he ' s where you will find it . 
POS wow . saw this last night and i ' m still reeling from how good it was . every character felt so real ( although most of them petty , selfish a * * holes ) and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter ' s feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing . top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the north ' s daniel craig ( the latter coming across as the next david thewlis ) . < br / > < br / > and director roger michell ? this is as far from notting hill as it ' s possible to be . thank god . < br / > < br / > watch this movie ! ! ! 
POS i have previously seen zu : warriors from the magic mountain . in that film , the setting takes place in china ' s mountains , the legend of zu looks like another dimension ! ! thank that to tsui hark ' s extensive use of cgi effects . he ' s able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds , a land where beings fly freely , and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades , split swords , and the ultra cool moon orb . < br / > < br / > while there are many characters in this one , the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma . the romance aspect is there , although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor . cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching . in the beginning , i like how she resembles the countess ( from zu warriors ) and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life . oh , by the way , did i mention that cecilia ' s very appealing to the eye ? ? < br / > < br / > in truth , zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 . tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema . 
POS by now you ' ve probably heard a bit about the new disney dub of miyazaki ' s classic film , laputa : castle in the sky . during late summer of 1998 , disney released " kiki ' s delivery service " on video which included a preview of the laputa dub saying it was due out in " 1999 " . it ' s obviously way past that year now , but the dub has been finally completed . and it ' s not " laputa : castle in the sky " , just " castle in the sky " for the dub , since laputa is not such a nice word in spanish ( even though they use the word laputa many times throughout the dub ) . you ' ve also probably heard that world renowned composer , joe hisaishi , who scored the movie originally , went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements . laputa came out before my neighbor totoro and after nausicaa of the valley of the wind , which began studio ghibli and it ' s long string of hits . and in my opinion , i think it ' s one of miyazaki ' s best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem . laputa : castle in the sky is a film for all ages and i urge everyone to see it . < br / > < br / > for those unfamiliar with castle in the sky ' s story , it begins right at the start and doesn ' t stop for the next two hours . the storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted , you see miyazaki ' s true vision . and believe me , it ' s one fantastic one . the film begins with sheeta , a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship . sheeta holds the key to laputa , the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization . the key to laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many , namely the government , the military and the air pirate group , the dola gang ( who sheeta and pazu later befriend ) . soon , the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid . she falls a few thousand feet , but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant . as she floats down from the sky , pazu , an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines , sees sheeta and catches her . the two become fast friends , but thanks to her pendant , the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the dola gang and government try to capture sheeta . one action sequence after another , we learn all of the character ' s motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it ' s fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue . plus somewhat twisty surprise . i think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time . the story is wonderful , as we peak into hayao miyazaki ' s animation which has no limits . the setting of the film is a combo of many time periods . it does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s , but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons . laputa is also surprisingly a funny film . the film has tons of hilarious moments , almost equal to the drama and action the film holds . i think the funniest part is a fight scene where pazu ' s boss faces off against a pirate , and soon after a riot breaks out . it ' s funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly . < br / > < br / > now let ' s talk about how the dub rates . an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life . teen heartthrob james van der beek plays the hero pazu , who has a much more mature voice then in the japanese version , where in the original he sounded more childlike . either way , i think his voice is a nice fit with pazu . anna paquin , the young oscar winner from " the piano " , plays sheeta . this is also a nice performance , but the voice is a bit uneven , she doesn ' t stay true to one accent . at times she sounds as american as apple pie , but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand . the performance i most enjoyed however was of coris leachman , who played mama dola . not only is this an excellent performance , but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life . if there was ever a live action laputa movie ( g - d forbid ) , she would be the one to play her , you can just imagine her in the role ( well , somewhat ) . luke skywalker himself , mark hamill is muska , and this is another top rate hamill performance . you may be familiar with hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original star wars movies , but he renders muska to full evil . his voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the joker , who he played for many episodes on the animated batman series . rounding out the cast is voice character actor jim cummings , who does a great , gruff job as the general and andy dick and mandy patakin as members of the dola gang . < br / > < br / > now let me talk about what really makes this dub special , joe hisaishi ' s newly arranged music ! for those who have never heard of him , mr . hisaishi does the music and like all of miyazaki ' s films , the music is very memorable . each of his scores has it ' s own personas which fits the particular film perfectly . now , these new arrangements he has done are more " american like " , which i think was the goal of the new recordings . don ' t worry , the classic tunes of the japanese version are still here in great form . the score , to me , sounds to be arranged like this is a hollywood blockbuster . it has more power , it has more emphasis , it ' s clearer and deeper . the film ' s prologue , the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships , has some new music ( i am not sure , but i believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all ) . but a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy . things seem very enhanced . in a powerful scene , the music is more stronger then in the original versions . in a calm scene , it ' s more calmer . overall , i think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes , i highly did myself , and personally think it helps improve the film . i prefer the new score over the old one , and i hope disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack . < br / > < br / > another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful , and much of the original japanese lines are intact . in kiki , i ' m sure a few lines where changed , and this is the same way , lines have been changed . but a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue miyazaki has written . i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered , but they were there intact . some new lines have been added as well which help out . but i am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing , disney did not translate the ending song , it was in japanese . i was mortified when they did completely new songs for the kiki dub , but with this version it ' s the original song . . . in japanese . so i guess it ' s good it ' s still the original , but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak english . < br / > < br / > there is a big down side to this dub , and it deals with how the voices match the character ' s lips . of course in any dub it won ' t be perfect , but i think in kiki and mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed ( and disney had a little bit more time with this one . . . ) . some of the time everything matches perfect , some of the time it doesn ' t completley match , and in a rare case , someone says something and the lips don ' t move at all ( there ' s a scene where sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn ' t move one bit ) . < br / > < br / > as far as things about the film itself , these are my thoughts . i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation . from the opening sequence to the ending , the animation is so lush and detailed , you just have to watch in awe . you see the true nature of each character , true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action . you have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film . everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn , it ' s like a moving piece of art . and to think , this was done in the mid 1980 ' s . the animation is quite different from disney , ghibli has it ' s own distinctive flare which is very different , but very good . and after all these years , the colors look as vibrant as ever . laputa also has tons of action sequences , lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground . these sequences are so well done and so intriguing , it ' s scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film . and the finale is just something you must see . the sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions , guns firing and everything else well . and like all miyazaki films , each one focuses on a different theme ( i . g . kiki : confidence ) . this one has a great a lesson on greed and power . people don ' t realize how greed can take over you , and how having too much power isn ' t good . people are obsessed with power , and are greedy , and the main villian , muska , greatly shows this . < br / > < br / > all in all , laputa : castle in the sky was a great film to begin with , and is now improved for the most part . i am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it ' s glory . with a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from joe hisaishi , disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy . though i think the voices matched the mouths better in the kiki and princess mononoke disney dubs , castle in the sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film . 
POS i loved this movie ! it ' s truly bizarre , extremely funny , morbid , witty . . . it makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie , because then i ' d be giving out the outcome ! you have to see it without knowing what is it about ! everything is connected and has its why & because . it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine ! it ' s even more fun to watch the movie the second time , once you know all the " tricks " . the actors are excellent , especially ivan trojan , whose final scenes are a real master piece ! i highly recommend this film , it ' s one of the most original ones i ' ve ever seen !

POS those childhood memories . . . when things were new , and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us ; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life . < br / > < br / > one of the initial memories i have from childhood is this animated program " galaxy express 999 , " about a young boy named tetsuro , who goes on a train ride around the galaxy , in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold - hearted , trophy gathering mechanical hunters . accompanying tetsuro on his journey is maetel , a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago . . . < br / > < br / > back in the early - 80 ' s , as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in seoul , south korea , " galaxy express 999 " was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from japan , which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them . the memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time . . . < br / > < br / > those were some wonderful memories , never to be had again . . . < br / > < br / > as i moved to america , and while residing here for over 2 decades , i sometimes wondered about that time and place , in a country thousands of miles away divided from america by an enormously vast ocean , of this childhood program , with its hit theme song , and of the boy named tetsuro , his protective companion maetel , the enigmatic train conductor , and of the spacefaring train galaxy express 999 . < br / > < br / > many , many years passed . . . < br / > < br / > last summer while i was in korea , i was able to track down a copy of the original " galaxy express 999 " ( 1979 ) on dvd , and it brought back a lot of nostalgic , heartfelt memories .

POS not only does this film have one of the great movie titles , it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors ike eissenman and kim richards . i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in ' 78 going against linda blair in stranger in our house . i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film . later , on repeat , i saw i made the right choice . the movie is not really bad , but , really lacks any chills or surprises . although , i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no avail . 
POS a kind of road movie in old - fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province . at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth , and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases , you see that the trousers - part is missing on a flag of mourning ( appearently his father has died ) . in the train he meets a young lady , and almost without words , but many small gestures , a wonderful love story begins . it ' s a somehow surreal , very poetic , and a little bizarre movie , with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents . beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details . 
POS i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it . the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over . the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside . if you can find any type of copy of this - - buy or rent it . you won ' t be disappointed , just awed . 
POS this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing , little to no continuity , insane dialog , bad ( you might even say non - existent ) acting , pointless story lines , shots that go on far too long . . . and it ' s perfect for mst3k - style riffing , not to mention the " corpse eaters drinking game " : scribble on forms . . . take a shot - sign your name . . . take a shot - catch a bad foley edit . . . take many , many shots . < br / > < br / > the only reason i didn ' t rate it higher than 8 is because there ' s not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness , it ' s only an hour long - hell , a movie like this should have been at least 20 - 30 minutes longer ! 
POS this 1953 sam fuller movie contains some of his best work , and its sad that he couldn ' t continue to get the backing of major hollywood studios to do his stuff . the story line goes something like this . a tough hard broad ( read prostitute ) is riding the subway one hot summer day , and gets her pocketbook picked by skip mccoy . what skip ( and the dame ) don ' t realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies . this opening shot without dialogue , and mostly in tight close - ups is a beaut , one of the many that fuller uses throughout the movie . playing the babe known as candy is jean peters , who was never better nor better looking . one forgets how beautiful she was , and she handles this role very well . the pickpocket is played by richard widmark , who had already made his mark , and set his style with 1947 ' s kiss of death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh , and although he ' s a little " softer " here , he ' s still scary . these hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there , but its noir and nasty all the way . the standout performance belongs to the wonderful thelma ritter , who plays moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral . ritter received a well deserved oscar nomination for her performance , but lost out to the boring but popular performance of donna reed as the b girl ( read prostitute ) in " from here to eternity . " hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad , and loves to oscar them even though their performance is usually awful . see for instance shirley jones in " elmer gantry . set among the docks and dives of new york city , with crisp black and white photography by the great joe macdonald , and some very good art direction . especially good is the set representing the new york city subways and widmark ' s shack near the river . made at the height of the cold war and red scare , the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie , played by richard kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal american . 
POS samuel fuller is hardly one of america ' s great directors . i ' m not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood ' s great craftsmen . but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood ' s true professionals who were willing to march to their own music . during the time he worked for hollywood studios , he knew how to take an assignment , shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts . . . on time and on budget . pickup on south street is a case in point . on the surface it ' s one more of hollywood ' s early fifties ' anti - commie movies , complete with appeals to patriotism , a hard - boiled hero and a slimy ( and copiously perspiring ) bad guy . fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichés into a taut , exciting drama with any number of off - kilter twists . the hero , skip mccoy , is a three - time loser , a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn ' t change his stripes until the very end . the girl in the caper , candy , has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you ' re so inclined . one of the most appealing characters , moe williams , is a stoolie . and in an unusual approach to hollywood ' s battle against commies , the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears ; the hero isn ' t motivated by anything so ennobling . he just wants payback for a personal reason , and winds up becoming . . . at least for now . . . a good guy . < br / > < br / > plus , all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio . he had to make do . richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star , but jean peters is a surprise . she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb , and no better than her boy friends . . . or her clients . . . want her to be . and richard kiley , who later would become a two - time tony award winning star on broadway , is convincingly slippery and cowardly . it ' s hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us , i mean introduced to us , " the impossible dream " from man of la mancha , < br / > < br / > more than anything else , this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash , pursued by the feds and the commies , moves straight ahead with great economy . the whole enterprise , with a classic noir look , only takes 80 minutes to tell . the dialogue , with fuller as screenwriter , has that party corny , partly pungent hard - boiled pulp fiction style . " that muffin you grifted . . . she ' s okay , " one character says to skip about candy . fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next . then fuller throws in the character of moe williams . all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest , part comedy relief and part sad inevitability . < br / > < br / > the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller ' s talents and strengths . in 2 minutes and 15 seconds , starting right after the credits , fuller is able to instantly power up the movie , to establish for us what the story is about , and to show us what kind of characters - - skip and candy - - we ' re going to be involved with . and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot , packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us . < br / > < br / > says glenn erickson , in my opinion one of the best of movie critics , " in what should be an inconsequential story , sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up : stiff - necked , aggressive self - interest that when fully expressed recognizes what ' s wrong and what ' s right and isn ' t afraid to fight for it . as always in his work , the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort . " he ' s right , and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years . 
POS kim basinger stars as della , a housewife who has twin children ( terri and tammi - played by luke gair and erika - shaye gair ) and an abusive jerk for a husband ( kenneth ) , played by craig sheffer . < br / > < br / > the movie opens on christmas eve . kenneth is on his way home from work , driving a nice car too i might add . he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner i would assume . when he gets home , he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about . this angers him even more and he takes up with his wife , della , asking her why the house is always a mess . he pins her up against the wall . the twin ' s watch from the stairs . he punches the wall , leaving a hole in it and walks away . she tends to the children , trying to comfort them . after that is all said in done , she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper . she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there . while she is looking for a parking space , she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her . she finally finds a spot to park , makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a " selfish jerk " . then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping . < br / > < br / > when she finally does leave the mall , it is closing and many people have left already . not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle . she also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there . odd . when she gets to her vehicle , she gets in to start it up . she notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up . she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car ( chuckie - played by lukas haas ) she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends . yelling ensues and a mall cop ( no , not paul blart ) makes his way over to them to see what the problem is , only to have his brains blown out of his head by chuckie . while this happens , della jumps in her vehicle , starts it and drives over the median in front of her . chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase . della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed . she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle , open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there . < br / > < br / > with that , della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons . the first kill , in my opinion , is the best . the first kill that della performs anyway . the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing . < br / > < br / > i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself . as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it ' s 1 hour and 20 minute run time . 
POS charleton heston wore one , james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth . i hope no one casts him as tarzan . linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way . tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at . even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain . she ' s cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end . as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints . lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy . this movie has three great actors tim roth , ms . carter & paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch . superlative make up ( a certain oscar ) costumes , sets , music make this the hit summer movie of 2001 . 
POS on the surface , this is an above - average post - war romantic comedy . beneath the veneer , it is mgm character actor stunt - casting at its funniest . < br / > < br / > the leads are straightforward , but all the secondaries are cast much against type . margaret hamilton ( aka wicked witch of the west ) , edward everett horton ( professional obsessive - compulsive fussbudget ) , and sig ruman ( the marx brothers ' nemesis in _night in casablanca_ and the always - wonderful _night at the opera_ ) , playing a well - intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together , instead of driving them apart as their " usual " characters would do . < br / > < br / > it also pokes fun at many romantic - comedy conventions , which is another indication that this could be not so much a " straight " romantic comedy , as it is a wry send - up of the many post - war romantic comedies & their 2 - dimensional , stock characters . < br / > < br / > i ' ve seen it only once , with interruptions , so i can ' t be positive , but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made , but is less successful now that viewers " see " these secondary characters through a completely different lens . i ' m assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars . i thought it was hysterical . 
POS if you haven ' t seen this obscure little charmer , you should seek it out . it is the story of a bumbling , wartime sad sack ( fred macmurray ) who is listed 4 - f each time he attempts to join any branch of the military . he finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie ( gene sheldon ) , but the genie is even more bumbling than macmurray is , sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants . it is cute , cheerful , and pure fluff , and you can ' t help but like it . the plots is much like a disney film , particularly since the two stars ( macmurray and sheldon ) both made numerous disney films in the 50 ' s and 60 ' s , although not together . needless to say , it all ends well for everyone , and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good . 
POS having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon , i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth . especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it . doesn ' t every movie , good or bad deserve more than four comments ? and this movie isn ' t bad at all . < br / > < br / > the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came , in this case the late fifties . films were pretty much a happy medium back then . the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television . i don ' t know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one , but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes . < br / > < br / > teen idol pat boone plays nick conover , a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta ( jeanette nolan ) and uncle jed ( arthur o ' connell ) out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car . it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son ( jed jr . ) so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living . aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums . story lines like this being what they are , jed and nick don ' t really care for each other too much of course . jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors , fran ( dolores michaels ) and liz ( shirley jones ) templeton . immediately jed develops a crush on fran , and of course i don ' t have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed . then there ' s the matter of uncle jed ' s horse , a trotter who has turned wild and won ' t let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr . you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own , seeing as how there are no real surprises . doesn ' t matter though , you ' ll enjoy yourself anyway . < br / > < br / > once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone , as a supposedly bad boy , you ' ll have no trouble with the rest of the film . considering that , boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick . certainly the role doesn ' t require much depth , but still it ' s a nicely done job when you would least expect it . as jed , arthur o ' connell is the perfect choice for the role . in the early going , he is unreachable and cold , but as he slowly warms up to nick , we see that he ' s really a pretty good guy . jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta , who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick . shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents . as liz , she ' s gorgeous to look at , great to listen to , and quite funny at times . dolores michaels as fran , who is a bit more on the wild side , is equally entertaining . < br / > < br / > the best thing about april love , is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen . not one true villain in the whole thing . everybody is so darn likable you can ' t help but enjoy the film . i truthfully find it quite refreshing , sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends . think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers , a little more plot , and wide screen technicolor . the songs are a mixed bag , with the title song april love being the best of them . another thing i really liked is that they didn ' t fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences , and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it . as a matter of fact , you ' ll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn ' t skimp in that department . the chemistry between jones and boone is good . best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect . < br / > < br / > this movie will never be confused with great cinema . yet , sometimes instead of going to disneyland , one just needs a nice outing in the park , and that ' s what april love is . < br / > < br / > my grade : b + < br / > < br / > 
POS along with the " maratonci trce pocasni krug " from the same director , one of the masterpieces of ex - yugoslavia comedies . if you want to understand serbian mentality , you must see this movie . and if you want to see several of ex - yugoslav great actors at the same time , this is a opportunity . 
POS at first sight , who ' s singing over there just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy with only a kind of unusual , quiet and slow motion : what a mistake ! < br / > < br / > beginning with two singers on a desert landscape , then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors , it hides a gem ! < br / > < br / > the folded story , and a false rhythm induces you to think , yes it is comic , but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie . < br / > < br / > not at all : very funny by instant , dark subtle cynical on others , its development surprises you all along the story very ingeniously and cleverly presented , all the characters are important , and the actors give them full life . < br / > < br / > and what is astonishing , it ' s based on deep observation , great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings , and really everything , the general direction and how also the details are presented , that it simply makes you forget it ' s a movie : it is like to watch a kind human society , you yet don ' t know , shot by a friend behind a camera . < br / > < br / > and you ' re the one behind him . it is simple , and simply exceptional ! < br / > < br / > don ' t misunderstand me ; in no way that would means the script , the quality of picture , the music score have a kind of amateurish way , no , no ! it ' s great art ! < br / > < br / > because it flows like a river from high up in the mountain , down to the sea , with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea from a tiny thing to a main stream . < br / > < br / > this metaphoric image i used is the very best way i can find to explain all the charm that has who ' s singing over there . for me , again , i take the hammer : simply exceptional . . . < br / > < br / > i ' ve seen that the director is the one who made chat blanc / chat noir , which i know is quiet famous but as i yet didn ' t see it , i had no idea about this gentleman . < br / > < br / > others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film , i fully agree ! < br / > < br / > european eastern cinema is not well know because seldom translated , but i am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language , with good english subtitles . all in all : deep , delicious and exceptional . . . < br / > < br / > for fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs , avoid it at any cost , it may be too subtle and good for you ! < br / > < br / > but if you ' re interested in different genres and / or classics , i guess you won ' t regret this one , and in case of buying , it will have good companionship in your personal dvd library , with such no less than merited big names like billy wilder , lubitsch , or sacha guitry among some of my preferred directors . at least for this movie ! < br / > < br / > * * * a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet orson welles * * * 
POS this movie awed me so much that i watch it at least once a year . at times i find it uncomfortable . at times i find it empowering . and i always find the characters human and real . it is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in la , starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters . it is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference . grand canyon reminds you that every action you take , whether intended or not , has powerful repercussions . i found this movie to be similar in many ways to robert altman ' s film short cuts . both had a star - studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other , for better or worse . grand canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message , ( hope in the face of despairing reality ) , than altman ' s film , although i found them both intriguing in their own way . this film is a definite must see ! ! ! 
POS i really liked this film when it was released , and i still do , because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general , and people too . . . one of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan . in addition to the positive vibes from the film , there are other reasons to like grand canyon . for one thing , it has an outstanding cast . . . kevin kline and danny glover , for example . in my opinion , crash , the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture , was very similar to this film . the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive . crash had the opposite effect with me ; it was very dark . i would choose grand canyon over crash any day . 
POS i ' m disappointed that reiser ( who wrote the film ) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever . maybe that ' s his idea of " adult " films , plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in ? i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie . < br / > < br / > falk ' s acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating . < br / > < br / > this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles . but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails . certainly not worth spending money on , though it might be worth a watch for free on television . 
POS this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey . one sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that " history repeats itself " . life is what it is shown in the movie : when people are young , they seem not to understand their parents , their own spouses ; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late ; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners ; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives ; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved ; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world , and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves , so that when life has to end some day , people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope - - - a new life . the actors and actresses are fantastic . they have understood the director ' s intention perfectly . the movie ' s charm lies in , to me , the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience . 
POS the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father . < br / > < br / > the brilliant dialog , lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers . < br / > < br / > the core issues of parenting , communication and manhood are explored indirectly . < br / > < br / > in fun ways the curtain is pulled back , the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed . < br / > < br / > all of this happens amidst a road trip format . the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors . wow ! 
POS paul reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don ' t see , what we expect and what surprises us . the thing about my folks doesn ' t set any new standards for film , but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents . < br / > < br / > sam kleinman ( peter falk ) has been a workaholic , at times pushing his wife muriel ( olympia dukakis ) , his daughters ( mackenzie connolly and lydia jordan ) , and his son ben ( paul reiser ) into the background . one day muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving ! her daughters , along with ben ' s wife rachel ( elizabeth perkins ) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts , leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle sam to sort things out on a road trip with son ben . the road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members . sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic ben to the pleasures and fun of living . the trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story ' s warm ending . all is not what it seemed : it ' s better and , well , different . < br / > < br / > falk and reiser play off each other like the pros they are , but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when olympia dukakis is on screen , reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film . well worth viewing . grady harp 
POS so fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the palm springs international film festival . upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film . looking at the card i turned to my wife and said , " how many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb ? only about 5 for me . " but then watching the interaction between peter falk and paul reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the film ' s setting of new york state , i slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time . certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film , the movie jumped to the excellent level . < br / > < br / > by the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the grinch ' s and i ended up giving this a superb . < br / > < br / > this picture is a must for anyone who has parents . no violence or nudity but some strong language . 
POS okay , this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars , but i ' ve voted for " 10 " to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo ' s who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews . each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers . . . three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big - time hollywood productions . performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive , with notable turns by bill paxton , james karen , vivian schilling and brion james . martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe - lamp , and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim . but overall , it ' s got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments . definitely worth seeing , so judge for yourself ! 
POS this was probably one of the most well - made films of the 40 ' s - warner bros . at the very height of their style . the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing . max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method . the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable . it ' s interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make " now , voyager " later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite , ciefly because it starred bette davis . in my opinion , " the gay sisters " is a much better film - better made in all departments , and more interesting , complex and enjoyable . a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is , rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper - critical perfection . each thing has to be judged in it ' s own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms . most of the complaints i ' ve read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point . if you ' re hungry for a perfect filet mignon , don ' t go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry . the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population . sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots , you ' d all be gleefully gratified . i ' ll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week ! 
POS three girls , the youngest descendents of the gaylord family , one of america ' s most royal families , are orphaned at a young age . right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi , their father tells the oldest , fiona , never to sell the land . by the time the sisters have become adults , they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property . through certain loopholes in the father ' s will , a man named charles barclay stands to gain possession of the gaylord land , on which he wants to build a complex called barclay circle . barclay is actually based on john d . rockefeller , who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in new york so he could build rockefeller center . < br / > < br / > this film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters . fiona , well played by barbara stanwyck , although it ' s certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles , seems like a cold , domineering woman , and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet . susanna , played by nancy coleman , is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young . coleman ' s was my favorite performance in the film . evelyn , played by geraldine fitzgerald , is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in england , but that doesn ' t stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister . the three sisters are developed quite well but , as is the major trend in the gay sisters , never well enough . charles barclay is played by george brent . he isn ' t very good . well , he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have , but he always seems like a scumbag in the film . when we ' re asked to sympathize with him late in the film , it ' s impossible . gig young is played by , huh ? , gig young . no , he ' s not playing himself . what happened is that the actor , who had acted in several movies previously under his real name , byron barr , was pressured by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy . i ' m not sure who made the final choice , but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young , after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters . weird , eh ? young is quite good through most of the film , but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience ' s sympathy for him . in two other supporting roles , helen thimig and gene lockhart are quite good . < br / > < br / > the gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas . the characters are all interesting , as are their situations . unfortunately , the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama . if it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex , fleshed out , for example , the rivalry between evelyn and susanna or made the flashback more intricate , the film could have been fantastic . it also could have fleshed out the prologue more , let us know more about the gaylord family . we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more . and the ending needed some major fixing . it basically just gives up at the end . fiona ' s problems are solved so poorly that it hurts . whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart . it ' s also far too happy . this story seems moving towards tragedy , or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss . and we still hate barclay . and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved . as bad as fiona ' s story ends , susanna ' s , gig ' s , and evelyn ' s is even worse . < br / > < br / > i still liked the film . it ' s thoroughly watchable , even if it doesn ' t involve us like other great films of the era . 7 / 10 , mostly for its potential . it should have been remade , or the novel should have been re - adapted , at some point during the studio era . it is too dated to be remade now . the 1950s would have been the best time , during the time of films like giant . 
POS mel gibson ' s braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film , but it left a sour taste in the mouth . rob roy , by contrast , is slightly less polished , but a better film by far . this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values , whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale . what makes this film is the cast . liam neeson plays the hero , in a role he basically reprised ( in a watered - down fashion ) in the phantom menace . the character is heroic , but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover . admirable yet human , he commands the screen . against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth ' s cunningham , obnoxious but brilliant , and john hurt ' s morally bankrupt laird . also to praise is jessica lange , as rob ' s pragmatic wife : also strong and noble , but 300 years away from a modern heroine , which is only as it should be . this is not the most original film you will see , but it has the courage of its own convictions , and the strong performances make you care . 
POS liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century . he is a true actor . he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles . jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary . mary is such a beautiful woman . it ' s her love that makes rob roy the legend , but it ' s his passion that makes her love undying . they need each other . tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect ; in one way or another , upon watching the movie , you will find cunningham disgusting . the scotland scenery is beautiful . the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well . if you like history , romance , passion and love , you ' ll enjoy rob roy . there is violence and blood , but it ' s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told ; no gratuitous violence . and you do have to listen carefully if you ' re not used to a scottish accent . one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized ; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes . it ' s their skill as actors that attracts you , they don ' t rely on marquee names , popularity or sex symbol appeal . this is something special . 
POS i enjoyed this film very much . tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake . he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen . and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film . he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before . the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all . i did not know what to expect from jewel ' s performance but i think she did rather well . lots of exciting scenes . a thoroughly good ride . i am absolutely a fan of maguire ' s . check out cider house rules . one of the all time best ever . 
POS ride with the devil , like ang lee ' s later brokeback mountain , is a film of aesthetic and historical importance . film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended . < br / > < br / > a perfect piece of art , surprising depth of humanity . i really don ' t recall another war film , will so capture you , will change your existing conception of history and politics , will restore your belief in humanity . after seeing so many killings , so many sufferings , you don ' t feel yourself numb , instead you treasure the bond between human beings more . the actors ' performances haunt your heart , the music drives your mind . some shoots , are not just some pictures , they transcend themselves , becoming the seeing of soul . such is the true sense of film being a genre of art . < br / > < br / > a film like this doesn ' t need long comments or reviews , everything it says by itself . ovation to the cast which includes tobey maguire , jeffrey wright and jewel kilcher , the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music , what an achievement ! 
POS alright , before we review , i have to ask : why isn ' t this listed individually ? it may have been merely a tv item in italy , but to international lamberto bava fans this is its own film . in america this film is distributed on vhs and dvd as either " the ogre " or " demons 3 " . yes , i know it has nothing to do with " demons " apart from one cast member and the crew . but yes , i personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so useful . < br / > < br / > finally , let ' s review " the ogre " . i ' ve seen the trailer for this many times on youtube and honestly found that rather scary . the movie itself ( it is feature length , therefore making it a movie ) has many many strong parts and does manage to scare . i was displeased by the last act , but on the whole i don ' t regret having bought the dvd before seeing it ( available from shriek show ) . i guess the film ' s tv origins explain the last act . i won ' t give out any spoilers . < br / > < br / > the plot is somewhat familiar : an american horror writer vacationing at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares . there are faint echoes of " the shining " , but this is a different brand of supernatural horror . the woman ( virginia bryant ) finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares , but her husband won ' t believe her . great atmosphere and terror follow . < br / > < br / > the multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky . the ogre cocoon effect was good , it reminded me a bit of uncle frank ' s resurrection from the first " hellraiser " . there ' s also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene . i give them props that the film never stooped to imitating american films with similar concepts , namely " a nightmare on elm street " . " the ogre " is an original . and the monster itself was a scary one , when it was presented correctly . < br / > < br / > on the shriek show dvd there is a lamberto bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic " demons " series . he also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed . indeed , this setting contributes a lot to the film . the simon boswell music helps too . < br / > < br / > there ' s lots of good stuff here . " the ogre " is not perfect , but it is very much worth seeing . take it is a lesser lamberto bava achievement . 
POS the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn ' t intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd , but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series . the music in demons and demons 2 was 80 ' s rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii : the ogre is a architectural horror so that ' s how demons iii isn ' t a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film . < br / > < br / > the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in , the ogre is another thing why i like the film . there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons ( demoni 3 ) and the church ( demons 3 ) . demons iii : the ogre is a good film as long as you don ' t compare it with demons and demons 2 . 
POS virgil manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse . chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property , manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods . he reports the crime to the police but there ' s no body to be found . troubled by disturbing visions , he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn " soft for digging " is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare . this minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue . some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent . the location sets provide plenty of creepiness : the eerie maryland woods rival those used in " the blair witch projcect " . give this strange horror film a chance . 9 out of 10 . 
POS anchors aweigh sees two eager young sailors , joe brady ( gene kelly ) and clarence doolittle / brooklyn ( frank sinatra ) , get a special four - day shore leave . eager to get to the girls , particularly joe ' s lola , neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the interruption of little navy - mad donald ( dean stockwell ) and his aunt susie ( kathryn grayson ) . unexperienced in the ways of females and courting , brooklyn quickly enlists joe to help him win aunt susie over . along the way , however , joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend . how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal ? and does joe end up with susie , who loves him too ? < br / > < br / > the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh , i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town , the kelly / sinatra collaboration from 1949 . both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structure - - all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot , and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them . yet , both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall . having now seen both films a third time , i still stand by that judgement . somehow on the town , as a film and a piece of entertainment , is just lighter , gayer , purely and simply * happier * . the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot , and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh . i ' m not quite sure why this is . the typical argument is that the latter film is over - long : at almost two and a half hours , this is certainly a valid criticism to make . i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it ! however , it ' s also a film that grows on you - - the more you see it , the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making . and yet , something just doesn ' t hang together quite right . it feels almost as if the script was pored over , and * every * single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted , and that ' s exactly what happened . no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up . . . and that ' s probably the film ' s biggest weakness . it has 16 numbers ( give or take a few ) , and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra , this really starts to turn one numb after a while . ( contrast this , for example , with the ten numbers in on the town . ) you might well feel that each song , each dance , can ' t be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking . . . and that ' s true . but that ' s also because the writers weren ' t more restrained in adding them in in the first place . < br / > < br / > all this long preamble doesn ' t mean there ' s nothing good about anchors aweigh . the musical * is * splashy with great songs bursting out all over , like the duets between kelly and sinatra ( ' we hate to leave ' , ' i begged her ' and ' if you knew susie ' ) , the singing of sinatra ( ' what makes the sunset ' , ' the charm of you ' , and the best of all , ' i fall in love too easily ' ) , and without a doubt the always inventive , always breathtaking dancing of kelly . it ' s also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre . grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing ( her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening ) ; jose iturbi ' s role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it ; even clarence ' s own brooklyn , pamela britton , is cute and charming . . . as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself ! sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his , and plays the innocent boy - man wonderfully ( a role he reprises in on the town ) . his singing is , as usual , simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing . his solo numbers might seem to drag a little , but when you ' ve got the voice of a century , showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film ! < br / > < br / > gene kelly ' s sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph . third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively , anchors aweigh really is kelly ' s film . his joe brady is a believable , real character - - he ' s tough on the outside , glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal , but he ' s actually the biggest softy on the inside . kelly makes this charming rather than cloying , but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands . and the * dancing * - - again , the film suffers from the ' too much of a good thing spoils the effect ' syndrome , as it does with sinatra ' s singing . but once again , if it ' s gene kelly doing the softshoe , or tapping across the screen in a sailor ' s outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief . . . might as well err on the side of overdoing it ! all of kelly ' s dances are breathtaking , be it the pared - down simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to ' i begged her ' , his ' mexican hat dance ' with the sweet wide - eyed little girl , or his lavish spanish - influenced dance ' la cumparsita ' . of course , the classic image left in audiences ' minds for all time would be kelly in his red , white and blue sailor suit , dancing with jerry mouse of ' tom & jerry ' fame . a well - deserved golden film memory , to be sure - - it ' s not often that one can say you ' re impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 , given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market . but gene and jerry still look great , with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look . it * would * turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself ( in cover girl ) and a cartoon animation . < br / > < br / > it ' s doubtless that this first daring , inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs . but it ' s also notable for being the first of three kelly / sinatra film collaborations , and though rather too drawn - out , still a great couple of hours of entertainment . watch it first , then again and maybe again - - it ' ll grow on you before you realise it ! 7 . 5 / 10 
POS francesca annis , michael kitchen and robson green ! ! wow , what a trio . . . ok , so this is no anna karenina , but it is a good love story , very well - written and well - acted by all . even a few ' laugh - out - loud ' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity , age bias , and parental aging / alzheimer ' s issues . < br / > < br / > quirky guitar music added to the story as well . < br / > < br / > while i have been a fan of ms . annis ' since ' lillie ' ( in the ' 70s ) and mr . kitchen ' s since ' the buccaneers ' and ' enchanted april ' , i have only recently discovered mr . green ( ' me and mrs . jones ' , ' touching evil ' , etc . ) , making me ask the question - why had i not seen ' reckless ' until recently ? ? ! ! admittedly more of a ' chick flick ' than something a man will sit through , it is perfect for a rainy afternoon ' s lazy viewing . 
POS i want to add to the praise for the production of this film , especially the luminous cinematography . firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery . the film was nominated for ( and won ) a single oscar - the first given for editing . mala ' s performance is moody , penetrating and powerful . 
POS home room was a great movie if you ' ve ever had drama in your life . it keeps you wanting to see more . wondering what the secret alicia is hiding . i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest . plus i usually don ' t cry over movies but this one made me cry each time . i wish i could find more movies like that one . all in all i thought it was a great movie . the more you watch of it the more you become part of it . the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma , because it had her daughter ' s name on it . my heart felt as if it had shattered just then . and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn ' t gotten hers yet . i loved it so much . 
POS when i heard that adrian pasdar was in drag in this movie , my expectations that i would watch the entire movie were low . the only reasons i gave it a chance were the magnificent julie walters and the recommendation of a friend . < br / > < br / > what i thought would be a broad " mrs . doubtfire " type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy . pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross - dressing on occasions . he transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion . julie walters is magnificent , is as her habit , as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love . 
POS although the movie is clearly dated , audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale . buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages : the stone age , the roman age , and the moden age , playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different " ages " . in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the " caveman " stereotype , who wins his love not by romance but by brute force , as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat , two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks ' " history of the world : part i " . the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing : although the times may have - a - changed , we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to " win the girl " ( keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america , a time when chauvinism was still en vogue ) . it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later , and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie ' s " modern times " to now . 
POS this could be a 10 if it wasn ' t for the quite predictable and hollywood - ish scenario . daniel day - lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time ( why not the leading may i ask ) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level . i personally was impressed with hugh o ' connor who played christy brown as a child . the very first scene i watched him was really strong . wow . 
POS had a bad day ? dog bit the mailman ? car wouldn ' t start ? people got on your nerves ? then refresh yourself with a delightful experience . < br / > < br / > two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a month ' s rental of a villa in italy . due to financial circumstances , two other women join them . two have humdrum marital lives ; one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past ; the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by life . < br / > < br / > as the spell of the villa permeates their spirits , each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook . this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them . as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them . . . and you will find your outlook altered , for the better . a delightfully uplifting movie ! 
POS i thought hugh o ' conor was astounding as the young christy brown , and really deserved greater recognition for his role . i couldn ' t believe how well he played the part . of course , daniel day - lewis was brilliant too . my favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty ! amazing performances by the two christys ( and other also ) . 
POS my older sister was born in march of 1985 and has cerebral palsy . in her 22 years of life , she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids . i have been the butt of everyone ' s jokes because my sister is disabled , and i still think to this day that nobody is , or ever will give a damn about her and her condition . then i saw this film . < br / > < br / > i knew what christy ' s family was going through . but they were lucky . christy could talk , he could communicate , and he had artistic skills . my sister can walk , but she can ' t utter a word , and she can ' t use her hands to do anything but grab onto things . but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister , and the ending ( to tell the truth ) made me cry . and i ' ve seen shawshank ! ! ! this film is seriously underrated , and it shouldn ' t . this movie tells people something . that people should be proud of their own lives . thinking you can ' t write well ? this guy wrote with his foot . thinking you ' re not attractive ? this guy got turned down by lots of girls , because of his condition . not the fastest runner ? christy couldn ' t even stand up . < br / > < br / > my point : parents of young children , i suggest your children watch this movie with you , so they ' ll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair , they don ' t stare at them like they ' re aliens . my sister got millions of stares , and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people . this film will teach people , that people who might not seem " normal " are people too . 10 / 10 
POS i , as a teenager really enjoyed this movie ! mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease . i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to ! be sure and rent it ! ! also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players ! : ) 
POS my wife , kate and i absolutely loved the series and can ' t wait for the next one ( hopefully there is a sequel ! ) . i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it , maybe because i am " old and grey " and still interested in life : - ) . if anyone has the full lyrics please send them . < br / > < br / > of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually . it ' s great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience . the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show . < br / > < br / > this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated , on a par with some of our other favourites , " spooks " and " hustle " . 
POS police story is a stunning series of set pieces for jackie chan to show his unique talents and bravery . some of the stunts here are among jackie ' s best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably jackie ' s greatest single fight sequence , more brutal and less comedic then say project a or drunken master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact . < br / > < br / > but unfortunately the rest of the film doesn ' t hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements . i always prefer jc in films such as project a where his natural comic talents shine through . in the serious confines of some elements of police story it just doesn ' t work for me . having said that though this is still up there with jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle . < br / > < br / > as usual with hong kong films avoid the english dubbed dvd version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles . < br / > < br / > great stunts , ok movie a fine starting point if you ' ve not seen a jc movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7 / 10 
POS version : universal / hong kong legends r4 dvd release . cantonese / english subtitles < br / > < br / > once upon a time , five years ago , the world was obsessed with ' the matrix ' , and i was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that ' terminator ' was better than ' matrix ' . i was but a simple teenage boy , looking for a good action movie , and then there was a shining light on a tv station i had never really watched , a little station known as sbs . one night i noticed in the tv guide that a movie starring jackie chan - ' police story ' would be on later . being fifteen , and having only seen ' rumble in the bronx ' and ' rush hour ' , i said . . . " wow awesome " and sat down to watch it , and continually shouted " wow awesome " as the movie progressed . two weeks later , after sbs had shown the ' police story ' trilogy , i knew i had found my new favourite actor . < br / > < br / > jackie plays chan ka kui , a hong kong cop who busts a major drug - lord , chu ( yuen chor ) . chu ' s secretary , selina fong ( brigitte lin ) , is being held by the police as a witness against chu , and chan is assigned to protect her . things go bad - reaaaal bad - when chu ' s case is dismissed and he decides he wants fong and chan dead . < br / > < br / > ' police story ' is one of the greatest action movies ever , and certainly one of my favourite jackie chan films . it starts off strong , and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed . everything in between is great . however , some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people . . . < br / > < br / > as a story , this is still one of jackie ' s better efforts . for an action movie , the story is pretty good , and jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting & plot intensive ' new police story ' . this isn ' t ' miracles ' , but maybe that ' s a good thing . < br / > < br / > ' police story ' is one of jackie ' s finest works . it got me hooked on jackie chan movies , and should provide a nice start for any potential jackie fans . the bad news for anyone who sees this first is that jackie chan movies don ' t come much better - 10 / 10 
POS i got this one a few weeks ago and love it ! it ' s modern , light but filled with true complexities of life . it questions and answers , just like other eytan fox movies . this is my favorite , along with jossi & jagger . this pictures a lot more , universally , than only the bubbles we may live in . you don ' t need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - i ' m not , but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies . at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further . relationships we have to live with are superficial , meaningful , deep , fatal , you name it . you don ' t know what ' s coming , and you definitely don ' t know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time . it is worth seeing several times . fox movies include great bonus material - here a great music video and " the making of " ( including explanation of the title , interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles ) . 
POS this is a rip - roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired . peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception , particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan . karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in ' streets of san francisco ' . i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though , appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on , particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes . one thing does concern me though , could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk , could someone please assist ? 
POS this was an exteremely good historical drama . john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character ' s manic affectations such as his strange dancing . emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover natalia . < br / > < br / > the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as ' eternal innocence ' ( i . e . ' lolita ' ) are evident in this film . i think i will now go on to read the novel . it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye . brilliant movie ! 
POS i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such , it is very impressive . it has the feel and pacing of a " true indie " , yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision , command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional . the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward . he , and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical " paint by numbers " type scripts . it ' s a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working . judd is fantastic as usual ; as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd . the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden . yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach . anyway , i found the film refreshing and entertaining . 
POS okay - i ' ll confess . this is the movie that made me love what michael keaton could do . he does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of james cagney , with charm to spare . < br / > < br / > the supporting cast are solid workers all , and will step right up and do a fine job in this ' 80s comedy . a spoof of the ' 30s - ' 40s gangster movies , it breaks new ground constantly , with remarkably original material . ( well , yeah - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made , it was original , and much of it has _not_ been copied elsewhere . ) watch joe piscopo warn people to not do ______ , with one of the great taglines of spoofs . watch roman moronie do things with english profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh . watch amazing sight gags , such as pet - store owner johnny kelly using the price - tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens . watch the greatest " warning against sex " educational film ever made . watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church latin done , while a guy who never took shop class assembles a thompson machine gun from parts . watch lines you ' ll be using in casual conversation for the next decade . watch maureen stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard - working mom , with surprise gags that you ' ll never see coming . < br / > < br / > if you see a gag that doesn ' t hit your funny bone , be patient - another will come along in 30 seconds or less , and the odds are , you ' ll need to pause until you ' re done rolling on the floor several times . duckies and bunnies ? them , too . watch for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings . < br / > < br / > there are a few minor flaws - but it ' s probably the best of the spoofs . some come close , but none of them are quite this good . 
POS given the low budget and production limitations , this movie is very good . it is plausible , realistic , and shows how the csikos ( hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains ( puszta ) risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis . we are drawn into strong feelings for the young , impressionable , yet highly courageous boy - - who admires the american pilot . if you ' re looking for special effects , superman heroes , and magical endings - - this movie is not for you . if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent , amoral nazis and their lack of compassion , then you will be enthralled by this movie . i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses , dogs , and humble , helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end , this movie will be one you ' ll remember for a long time . 
POS after seeing ' break a leg ' in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film . < br / > < br / > i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos ( eric roberts in particular ) were a scream . i haven ' t heard word about actual release date although i ' ve heard it ' s close . < br / > < br / > the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations . the script is smooth and seamless , the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh . this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it ' s been in , which is around 10 - 15 or so . < br / > < br / > i highly recommend ' break a leg ' . 
POS a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition . but what makes break a leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling ( and not so ) la actor . it brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit . it ' s also got a polished look and very adept direction under monika mitchell . break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn ' t compromise its production values at any level . the writing is tight , the dialogue first rate . cassini is an actor ' s actor , and the role really shows off his talents . the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic , and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time . i saw it at an advanced screening , and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards . 
POS i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it . then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it . i am ready to watch it again . < br / > < br / > i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian ? the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites . < br / > < br / > of course the martial arts are stunning . there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style . however , if you are not . . . we paused playback briefly and walker , texas ranger was on . we noticed that after every strike there was a cut . not in black mask . < br / > < br / > 
POS hak hap ( black mask ) is what i ' d like to call a ballet with fists and explosions . sure the plot has been tried and heard before , ( a biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren ' t the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist , and a librarian . but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police - his best friend is a cop - he becomes the black mask . ) the style that the movie goes for , very visual , works and at least for me is entertaining . i love martial arts movies that are a spectical . people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop . but that is what this movie is about anyway right , a showcase of jet li doing what he does best , and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills , which to say the least are top notch . as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala . jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time , these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats . but i must say , even with the large holes left in the plot ( like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape ? who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment . . . . . . . ohh well suspension of belief i guess ) , the movie to me stays interesting . it is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter . but still all around a great high paced action movie . 
POS don ' t know how this missed award nominations . great film . certainly of the calibre of " beautiful mind " great acting , photography , script and drama . i can ' t imagine anyone not being entranced by this film . 
POS in stand by me , vern and teddy discuss who was tougher , superman or mighty mouse . my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too . sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix . but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan , bruce lee and jet li . it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead , but it is a fun one . and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask , you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan . in this film he comes across as a martial arts god . < br / > < br / > black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men , to be supreme fighting machines . their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose . they are invincible in some ways . now that is the premise for the film , but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes . < br / > < br / > jet li is a marvel . he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do . and that is what makes watching him so fun . < br / > < br / > besides the martial arts in the film , black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co - star , the police officer . they are great together . but to be honest . if anyone is reading this review , they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department . and the answer to that is a resounding yes ! ! ! lots and lots of gory mindless action . you will love this film . 
POS i thought " the river of souls " was a very good babylon 5 movie , with some exceptional performances from martin sheen , tracy scoggins and ian macshane . if this were an episode of the series ( without the humour ) it would probably be one of my favourite stand - alone stories of the series . < br / > < br / > personally , i ' ve always preferred scoggins to christian , although granted jms didn ' t write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byron / telepath plot . if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the " poorer " actors in those scenes , then this movie is solid stuff . probably my third favourite of the four movies , but in no means bad at all . 
POS a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there . on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story . so , there is more . there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player . < br / > < br / > this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely . it ' s easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film . the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting . < br / > < br / > i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i don ' t play the game myself but it looks nice and believable . all in all , most of the film goes down very easily . it is also forgotten again very easily though . so it ' s nice to watch but nothing more than that . < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place 
POS if it ' s action and adventure you want in a movie , then you ' d be best advised to look elsewhere . on the other hand , if it ' s a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood , check out " the straight story . " < br / > < br / > richard farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly alvin straight , in this true story of alvin ' s journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke . < br / > < br / > farnsworth is perfect in this role , as he travels his long and winding road , making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way . the story moves along as slowly as the riding mower , but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching , waiting for the next life lesson alvin ' s going to offer . < br / > < br / > stretch out on the couch , relax and enjoy . it ' s the only way to watch this very good movie , which rates a 7 / 10 in my book . 
POS who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother , could possibly be good cinema ? i certainly didn ' t . i thought i knew what to expect : one of the most boring experiences of my life . well i was as wrong as i haven ' t been wrong too often yet , because this is one of the best , most realistic and honest hollywood films i ' ve ever seen . . . < br / > < br / > giving a short resume of " the straight story " isn ' t very difficult . it ' s about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke . that ' s already special on itself , but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn ' t seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument . in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems , but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life . despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks , not knowing if he will reach his goal : seeing his brother again before it ' s too late . . . < br / > < br / > i can easily understand why there are people who don ' t like this movie and that ' s also the reason why i will not say that these people don ' t have a heart or things like that . . . this movie hasn ' t got any flashy action scenes , it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no , you don ' t have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either , because there isn ' t any . but why should you watch it then ? well , the simple answer is the story . i haven ' t seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and - to make things even better - from the disney studio ' s ( that ' s right , the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense ) makes it even more special . i ' m not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it , probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me . < br / > < br / > some people will argue that the story is very shallow , but i really don ' t agree with that . perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don ' t want to think any further . if you look close enough than you ' ll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong , that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too , so they won ' t make the same mistake . if that isn ' t deep enough , how much deeper does a story have to go for you then ? < br / > < br / > i would also like to add that this movie really had it all . some beautiful landscapes ( finally an american movie that shows something else than the skyline of new york , chicago or some other big city ) , some very fine acting by richard farnsworth , sissy spacek , . . . and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie . i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn ' t be to my taste . it ' s one of the very best movies i ' ve seen in a long time . this movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull ' s eye . i give it the full 10 / 10 . 
POS this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff . rather , it ' s for those who either appreciate a good story , or have grown tired of the run - of - the - mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprah - ish " this is such a wonderful movie ! you must see it ! " - semantics ( tho ' she is right , for once ! ) . < br / > < br / > the story unfolds flawlessly , and we are taken along a journey that , i believe , most of us will come to recognize at some time . a compassionate , existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise . < br / > < br / > acting is without faults , cinematography likewise ( occasionally quite brilliant ! ) , and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story . < br / > < br / > a warm movie . not excessively sentimental . 
POS the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game . so many people have seen this film and just don ' t get it , and i don ' t understand why . while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me . i will try to explain this without any spoilers , but be forewarned , i do talk about things that happen in the movie . < br / > < br / > * * * * possible spoilers * * * * be forewarned ! * * * * < br / > < br / > his is a life of " large moves " versus " small moves " . he chooses natalia to be his queen , and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy . listen closely to that description . < br / > < br / > when someone asks him a question , he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves . ( the flashbacks are beautifully lit , by the way . ) the flashbacks are quite interesting as well , for they give not only his point of view as a child , but the point of view of the other character as well . it ' s stunning . < br / > < br / > various characters become either his helpers or his enemies , pawns , bishops and knights , their actions enlightening you as to who ' s side they are on . even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on . beautifully done . < br / > < br / > i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin , but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end . < br / > < br / > this film is constantly working on many levels , which is why i endorse it . it was a treat and a joy to watch . < br / > < br / > if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh . the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces . < br / > < br / > 
POS just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn ' t go anywhere , we are given a treat , a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by emily blunt , a marvel in the leading role , paul bettany , rupert friend , miranda richardson , and mark strong , as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of england ' s most powerful monarchs . " the young victoria " dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power . < br / > < br / > emily plays the queen , with a good combination of raw strength and innocence , someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand , but who possesses enough confidence to move forward . she is able to portray victoria , as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand . < br / > < br / > victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown , and even when she takes command of her new position , she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course , the right support . luckily for victoria , there is albert , a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate . there is amazing chemistry between the two performers , and there ' s little doubt what the outcome will be , but there is the figure of bettany ' s prime minister , a man who provides victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her . < br / > < br / > miranda richardson and mark strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl . every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development , but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by blunt , an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances . in here , she is given the breakout role of her career , a real life historical figure , who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time . she shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years . she also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes . < br / > < br / > " the young victoria " is not a royal epic portrayal of england ' s ruling class . it is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them . in the end , the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction . in here , there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far , and there is of course , a good old fashioned love story . 
POS overall , i thought it a very nice movie - i hate to use the word ' nice ' as it ' s rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong . what i liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings , all gilded and shiny , this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good , strong writing ( thank you julian fellowes : d ) ; nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp , i . e not sensationalised greatly ( when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen , well you couldn ' t get a less glamorous hand over of the crown ) . it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth . < br / > < br / > undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert , though somewhat fairytale - ish on the face it , was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people ' fitted ' together despite the union being initially arranged ( my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind ; so much said without any words , that ' s what film is all about ) . blunt held her own beautifully as well , she has a face that demands your attention and i can ' t not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous . if i was blunt i would have trouble parting with any of them ! the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well , harriet walter as queen adelaide being a highlight . < br / > < br / > the only qualm i have , is that it lacked a sense of urgency , or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting ? ( it was rather tame ) i don ' t know , i wanted ' something ' to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more . when she and albert argued , i loved it , i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments , though that may be just me . < br / > < br / > lastly , at the risk of sounding all patriotic , it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position , especially in one so young . this may be in part to the fact that this film ' s snap shot of victoria ' s young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in ' the sword & the scion ' but nevertheless , it did flag up those feelings ( for those following my book , can you guess what character victoria so aptly reflects ? ) it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn ' t seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation , which only in turns renews appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic domain . it made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then i suppose . < br / > < br / > blog on films and books : http : / / sempergratis . blogspot . com 
POS ghost train is a fine and entertaining film , typical of the better british comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s . the antics of comedian arthur askey are not as funny as they once apparently were , but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity . < br / > < br / > for a low - budget wartime production , ghost train is atmospheric , effective , and it provides some genuine suspense . great fun for a dark ( and , yes , stormy ) night . lighten up , take off the critic ' s hat , and enjoy . 
POS i couldn ' t wait to get my hands on this one , when i read about fred astaire teaming up with george burns & gracie allen in a movie with a script by p . g . wodehouse and music by the gershwins . it is definitely worth seeing , but lacks the cohesive quality of the fred & ginger movies . < br / > < br / > the story would probably be better to read in a wodehouse book , where the humor comes across better . some of the acting is downright painful to watch ( notably the young boy and the damsel ) . < br / > < br / > but . . . ! the funhouse dance is worth more than most movies . i never knew that gracie allen could dance , but boy does she in this movie . have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ? imagine tapdancing on one in high heels ! she keeps up wonderfully with astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture . < br / > < br / > several nice songs , particularly fun are nice work if you can get it and stiff upper lip . < br / > < br / > recommended for fans of astaire , burns & allen . i had to go back and re - watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled . 
POS disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a foggy day and several other dances , one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine . here we see astaire doing what are essentially " stage " dances in a purer form than in his films with ginger rogers , and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film . best of all : the fact that we see burns and allen before their radio / tv husband - wife comedy career , doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 30s . ( george was once a tap dance instructor ) . their two numbers with fred are high points of the film , and worth waiting for . the first soft shoe trio is a warm - up for the " chin up " exhilarating carnival number , in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions . it almost seems spontaneous . fan of fred astaire and burns & allen will find it worth bearing up under the " plot " . i ' ve seen this one 4 or 5 times , and find the fast forward button helpful . 
POS this was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many , many times . the casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters . there are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format . as for judi dench , she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars . i always make a point to see judi dench in all her performances . she is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life . i can only be grateful when i see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting . the movie public needs heroes , not deviant manikins , who lack ingenuity and talent . how wonderful to see old favorites like leslie caron , olympia dukakis and cleo laine . i would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves . thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment . i congratulate the writer , director , producer , and all those who did such a fine job . 
POS elia kazan , one of the best theater directors this country ever had , showed he was equally at home with movies . with " panic in the streets " , mr . kazan gives us an early version of what would come later , with perhaps his master piece , " on the waterfront " , although both movies share only the water setting , for they are different visions about different subjects . < br / > < br / > mr . kazan shot on location in new orleans . the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film , is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting " the big easy " . one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best . also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch . < br / > < br / > this film , could have been shot in new york , or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like " broklynese " than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country . < br / > < br / > one thing comes clear in the movie , jack palance , making his screen debut , smolders the screen every time one sees him . he was so intense ! at the same time , this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner , who unknown to him , is stricken with a fatal disease . blackie , comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man ' s greasy hair with abandon . notable also , was the fact that mr . palance and mr . mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts , something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real . < br / > < br / > the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film . we see a family man painting furniture with his young son . later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can ' t make ends meet with his salary , something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis . richard widmark , playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people . barbara bel geddes , as the wife , sounds as though she ' s a suburban woman from connecticut . < br / > < br / > the film is enjoyable thanks to mr . kazan ' s direction and the excellent cast working in the movie . 
POS a great , funny , sweet movie with morgan freeman ( who plays himself ) and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet ( paz vega ) at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film . i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film . it shows how a positive attitude can change anything . it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty cliché romance . it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter . a very rare masterpiece ! 
POS this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season . it celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness . morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himself - - a successful actor pushing 70 . he has traveled to a small , rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play , as a manager of such a place . he soon beguiles the staff and the customers , especially the lovely , if cranky , young woman ( paz vega ) who presides over the " 10 items or less " checkout lane . < br / > < br / > 10 items or less doesn ' t have a big statement to make and doesn ' t pretend that it does . it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly , and as the older man offers his counsel , in exchange for a ride home - - the movie - company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can ' t call for help . i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick cured what ailed me . 
POS leave it to braik to put on a good show . finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast . i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot . they are completely what started adult swim . brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 . it may not have been platinum , but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows . i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot , this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made . that is why i like it so much , it is just such a classic in the adult swim history . i believe this is just such a great show , if you don ' t like it . hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it . 
POS diego armando maradona was , and still remains as the best football player , the game has offered . not just an athlete , but an artist . this documetary if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world . because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal , which he scored against my own country ( england ) . there ' s absolutely no point of diminishing this star . although i dont undersand spanish , i can appreciate the argentine narrator . he actually cries of happiness , and can barely express his emotion . . . . . anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend , but readers . . . . . you have to watch this to know what i mean . 
POS call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series . if you haven ' t had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series , you should definitely watch this one . perhaps more compelling than that of voyager ' s caretaker , which launched the series with cpt . janeway , archer ' s adventures are completely different , yet strangely familiar . . . the music is catchy too . no true sci - fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode - - and these installments make the wait worthwhile . 
POS it ' s a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us . i found it through a rare video dealer , and it was certainly worth it . this is , without a doubt , the best film made during the pre - code era , and the finest film of the 1930s . masterful director frank borzage made wonderful films about the depression , and with man ' s castle he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era . < br / > < br / > loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them , and they help make this movie a wonderful romance . young ' s trina is sweet and hopeful , while tracy ' s bill is gruff and closed - off . the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult , but in the end rewarding relationships on film . < br / > < br / > man ' s castle is the most soft - focus pre - code film i ' ve seen . borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter ' s village where bill and trina live into a palace . the hardships of the depression are never ignored , in fact they ' re integral to the film . but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale , the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh . it makes the film warm and affectionate . < br / > < br / > man ' s castle is the crowning achievement of the pre - code era . if only more people could see it . 
POS barbra streisand ' s first television special was simply fantastic ! from her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high - fashion department store - - everything was top - notch ! it was easy to understand how this special received awards . < br / > < br / > not muddled down by guest appearances , the focus remained on barbra thoughout the entire production . 
POS barbra streisand ' s debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media . cleverly divided into three separate acts ( to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks ) , streisand made the bold - yet - masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time ( which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter ) and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone . the risky move paid off enormously , as my name is barbra set a new standard for musical programming on television . < br / > < br / > filmed in glorious black - and - white ( which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show ) , my name is barbra is flawlessly - conceived and impressively shot . however , what makes the show truly transcendent is streisand herself . watching the then - 23 year old performer navigate herself through the show ' s 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling . she is in fantastic voice ( and even performs the entire first and third acts live ) , and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen . < br / > < br / > the special ' s biggest asset is it ' s boldness in allowing streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs . after the powerful opening performance of " much more " ( with a brief opening snippet from leonard bernstein ' s " my name is barbara " ) , barbra proceeds to wander through a multi - level studio set performing a frantic version of the disney classic " i ' m late . " in between verses of " i ' m late , " streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting " make believe " and the thundering " how does the wine taste ? " halfway through the act i , barbra re - enters her own childhood to the strains of " a kid again , " and then gives highly energetic performances of " i ' m five " and " sweet zoo " while romping among an over - sized set . the illusion is eventually shattered , however , as streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world . she then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely " where is the wonder ? " streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room - full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of " people " before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience . < br / > < br / > act ii of the special begins with streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of " i ' ve got the blues , " before delivering a comedy monologue about " pearl from istanbul . " streisand then heads off to bergdorf goodman ' s department store , which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the store ' s elegant fashions . this segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics . some high points of the act ii medley include streisand singing a restrained version of " second hand rose " to the audience , appearing as a latin bullfighter to the tune of " nobody knows you when you ' re down and out , " and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to " brother , can you spare a dime . " the third act of the special is a straight concert , with no set pieces or concepts . streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage , and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special . streisand enters belting out an almost gravity - defying rendition of " when the sun comes out , " and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of the yearling ballad " why did i choose you , " a scorching performance of " lover come back to me , " and an impassioned medley of three songs form funny girl . streisand really outdoes herself , however , with a phenomenal rendition of the fanny brice / billie holiday standard " my man , " which instantly became on of the singer ' s best - loved signature songs . < br / > < br / > streisand performs her immortal ballad version of " happy days are here again " as the closing credits roll by on the left - hand side of the screen . the iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special . my name is barbra was a huge rating triumph when first aired , and it eventually picked up five emmy awards in addition to spawning two top - five , gold - selling soundtrack albums . watching it all again , it ' s absolutely no surprise . 
POS this movie is one of my very favorites . it ' s hard to explain why . maybe it ' s the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak , but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack . also , some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves . finally , the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings , and the last scene is so bittersweet . all in all , i love this movie ; it ' s perfect for a gooey , sentimental girls ' night . 
POS what a real treat and quite unexpected . this is what a real thriller movie is all about . i rushed into the video shop , grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best . i was totally surprised and delighted . i really enjoyed the actors and their characters . i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic . the plot was well thought out , well written and directed . it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute . < br / > < br / > i highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers , especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention . definitely a 10 out of 10 from me . 
POS the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect . it ' s a very good thriller . well shot . tough to believe it was bill paxton ' s directorial debut , though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version . < br / > < br / > still , there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton . < br / > < br / > it ' s a solid story with some great twists at the end , several of them , all believable , all fun , and best of all , obscured well enough to make them true twists . < br / > < br / > the child actors in the movie do a great , too . i ' m usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects , but both these kids do a good job . < br / > < br / > this movie is not gory . it ' s not very scary . but it is very , very creepy . 
POS a very good start . i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced : it should have been cruder , to match we saw in the original series . the cast is interesting , although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human . she needs to school on spock who , after all , is the model for this race . too bad they couldn ' t have picked jeri ryan . i like ms . park , the korean ( ? ) lady . the doctor has possibilities . haven ' t sorted out the other males , except for the black guy . he ' s a really likeable . bakula needs to find his niche - - in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything . he is , of course , big and strong enough for the heroics . the heavies were ok , although i didn ' t like their make - up . 
POS if you know the story of grey owl , you ' ll love the movie ! annie galipeau is a great actress , and pierce is better than never in grey owl . but in this movie there ' s no real scene of action . i think this movie should be nominated at the oscars ! welll go see this movie , it ' s a classic ! 
POS recently i was looking for the newly issued wide screen dvd of fly away home and came upon interesting title that i had never heard of : grey owl . the fact that it was a richard attenborough film caught my attention ( he responsible for such fine films as gandhi , chaplin , and shadowlands ) . i noticed that the screenplay was by william nicholson ( author of shadowlands ) . this " special edition " was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $ 10 . 00 - - so i chanced it & bought it . wow ! what a beautiful film . pierce brosnan stars as archie grey owl , a real life trapper in the 1930s , who came to love and respect the wild lands of canada , and worked to help protect them . brosnan ( who starred in a james bond film ) gives a shaded , warm , powerful performance as does annie galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land - - especially the beaver . a fine score by george fenton ( the crucible ) and beautiful photograhy by roger pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film . and the extras on this dvd are something else ! includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real grey owl as well as audio commentary tracks by attenborough and producer jake eberts ; 2 featurettes ; and many other fine additions plus options for those having access to a pc with dvd - rom features . grey owl has been released directly to dvd in the united states - - a fact that richard attenborough attributes to hollywood ' s lack of interest in distributing something that isn ' t loaded with a lot of violence and sex . this is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about . i had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion - - and a whole new love and understanding for beavers ! grey owl is a very fine film - - worth checking out ! this is one i look forward to sharing with others . 
POS in the hands of lesser actors than claudette colbert and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite . but , with these two experienced thespians leading the way , i found " silent fury " to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery . when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that colbert is already married , and that he was best man at that wedding , one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work . as colbert , ryan , and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage , they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed . although it ' s not very difficult to figure out just who the main " baddie " is , it ' s still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases . all in all , a good , solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly . 
POS the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland , winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants , both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead . michael gaffikin ( james warwick ) a former paratrooper in the british army , is the local dentist , he ' s not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson ( celia imrie ) is always being viewed with a little suspicion , not maliciously , but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin . the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman . he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip ( maurice roëves ) at the islands police station , inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp , dr goudry , for closer inspection . a quick search for the killer proves fruitless , as does a search for a missing local woman . over dinner that night with michael gaffikin , fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson , a woman from the mainland , who lives on the island through the winter months . a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body , her home proving to be the murder scene , but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods ? suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island , one colonel howard ( jonathan newth ) who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together . < br / > < br / > goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body , it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength , one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer , another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind . a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain . with a heavy fog rolling in , the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help , the radio also doesn ' t work , seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut . reports of ufo ' s and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach . inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin ' s idea that aliens might be involved , but a rise in radioactive levels on the island , has him doubting himself . < br / > < br / > the nightmare man is based on the novel , child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire , it is here adapted by dr who and blake ' s 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci / fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board . the nightmare man though is on the whole , a succinctly better crafted piece , that builds its plot alongside solid character development , even down to the minor characters , time is given to giving them all a firm background . the island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over , but its one that i enjoy very much , the remoteness , the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts . in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama , but credit to camfield , he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times . there is an authenticity about proceedings , the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point . if there is one negative about the killer its that , we are given his / her / its pov for the killings , an acceptable cliché on its own , but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens , it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little . still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer , given the clues presented , but it ' s a fun and very well acted piece . the local scottish cast are exceptional , the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold . imrie , never one i ' ve taken to in other works , is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production . the outlandish , maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers , it disappointed me in some ways , but taking into account when it was made , its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it , is even more terrifying . 
POS quick and simple , i love this movie . < br / > < br / > as some others have mentioned , i also , am not from the south , don ' t really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat . ( i ' ve never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either , but i love " goodfellas . " ) this is just great film making . shot in a 2 . 35 aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to dvd . ( the vhs was 1 . 33 full screen ) . and yes , a solid 5 . 1 mix for your viewing pleasure . what can you say about this movie ? < br / > < br / > it ' s just a great love / hate story set in texas , with great performances . travolta is fantastic . next to " pulp fiction " , it ' s the best thing he ' s done . it ' s been in my top 5 for 25 years ! ! < br / > < br / > check this one out ! ! ! it ' s a 10 ! ! ! ! 
POS maybe the greatest film ever about jazz . < br / > < br / > it is jazz . < br / > < br / > the opening shot continues to haunt my reverie . < br / > < br / > lester , of course , is wonderful and out of this world . < br / > < br / > jo jones is always a delight ( see the sound of jazz as well ) . < br / > < br / > if you can , find the music ; it ' s available on cd . < br / > < br / > all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel . < br / > < br / > what shadows and light - what music - what a hat ! 
POS this movie has recieved horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like dude wheres my car and dumb and dumber this movie is for you . if your into movies like citizen kane and casablanca id have to sugest you in a different angle . yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of " kiddy " this is one of the few movies me and my freinds have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible . great movie . this movie should the afis number 1 because its so friggin ' high class . the only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists . so i dont know how to get this movie , id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere . i still have it taped from when it was first on , you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping . this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know . 
POS after going for a bike ride that day , lying beside a lake in a nature reserve , spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it , this film made absolute sense to me . < br / > < br / > the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need . switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done . < br / > < br / > reminded me of baraka ( 1992 ) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph . < br / > < br / > this comment requires a minimum of ten lines , ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten . after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment . 
POS this film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy . while i found that world morally repulsive , the film did best what storytelling should do , and that is take us through an experience that we would otherwise never undergo . tim meadows so convincingly portrays leon phelps , and the story so drew me into the reckless world of leon , that i momentarily forgot that i was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it . herein lies the film ' s undoing because its great and bold achievement in storytelling comes at the price of its own success . understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will respond only to the story of this film that lies on the surface , and reject that story , i hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that i loved it . i loved it not only for its fascinating insights into the deluded mind of the playboy , not only for its amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive , but also for its courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadows of heterosexuality . besides , it ' s just funny . 
POS this was directed by ruggero deodato , a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious cannibal holocaust . however , don ' t expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a conan inspired outing for a young audience . < br / > < br / > such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole conan inspired sword & sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this , it has to be said , this movie is just so much fun ! < br / > < br / > it ' s mostly played for laughs and features two huge and highly likable heroes in the form of david and peter paul aka . the barbarian brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters . < br / > < br / > b - movie favourite richard lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it ' s also great to see roles for big george eastman and michael berryman . < br / > < br / > added to this , the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration ( a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre ! ) < br / > < br / > what can i say , - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and i recommend it wholeheartedly ! 
POS absolutely hilarious . john waters ' tribute to the people he loves most ( baltimoreans ) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at . it ' s like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch ! i haven ' t laughed so much in a theater since serial mom . i loved seeing old friends from the dreamland days , sharon nisep and susan lowe , back in front of waters ' camera . the cast is simply wonderful ( especially edward furlong and martha plimpton ) . uses the best elements of past waters atrocities ( especially the underrated polyester ) and plenty of new surprises . made me sick , in a wonderful way . thanks , john ! 
POS went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend . the place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines . i knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than i thought it would be . i liked both edward furlong and christina ricci , they seemed really weird just like normal people , if that makes sense . i get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people , like " jock " or " geek " or " cheerleader " . . . etc . both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to . i will be recommending this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on dvd , go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life ! i plan to see it again in the theater and i don ' t go see things more than once very often . 
POS having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off vh - 1 , i just had to comment . < br / > < br / > the first time i saw this film on tv , it was about 1981 , and i remember taping it off of my mother ' s betamax . it wound up taping in black and white for some reason , which gave it a period look that i grew to like . < br / > < br / > i remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song , " my bonnie " , as the camera panned over a scene of liverpool . i also remember the opening scene where paul gestures to some girls and says , " look , talent ! " so it was with great irritation that i popped in my 1998 taped version and " remembered " that the film opens with " she loves you " , instead of " my bonnie " . when you see how slowly the camera pans vs . the speed of the music , you can see that " she loves you " just doesn ' t fit . also , in this " later " version when paul sees the girls , he says , " look , girls ! " . . and somehow having remembered the earlier version , that word just didn ' t seem to fit , either . why they felt they had to americanize this film for american audiences is beyond me . personally , if i ' m going to watch a film about a british band , i want all of the british colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech , mannerisms , etc . < br / > < br / > another irritation was how " choppy " the editing was for television . just after stu gets beaten , for example , the film cuts to a commercial break - lots of ' em . yeah , i know it depends on the network , but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart , as we all know . what some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue ( and thereby okay to edit ) , may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows . < br / > < br / > my point is , the " best " version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from 1981 , which just so happened to include the " shake , rattle & roll " scene that my 1998 version didn ' t . i started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television , and a look at the " alternate versions " link regarding this film proved me right . that the american version had some shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things . imo , ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film , if possible , and ( probably even less possible ) , an unedited version . sadly , i had to discard my old betamax european version because i didn ' t know how to convert it . < br / > < br / > all that aside , i found this film to be , perhaps , one of the best films regarding the story behind the " birth of the beatles " . being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and tv when portraying events in history , i didn ' t let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film . sure , you see the beatles perform songs at the cavern that made me wonder , " did they even write that back then ? ? i don ' t think so " , but , nevertheless , i thought it was a great film and the performances , wonderful . < br / > < br / > the real stand - out for me , in fact , was the actor who played john , stephen mackenna . i just about fell in love with him . his look , mannerisms , personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot - on . he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double - take towards the end of the film when you see the beatles performing on ed sullivan for the first time . i actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual beatle footage , until i saw the other actors in the scene . < br / > < br / > if you ' re looking for a dead accurate history of the beatles ' life and beginnings , you can ' t get any better than , " the beatles ' anthology " , as it was " written " by the boys ' , themselves . however , if you ' re looking for a fun snapshot of their pre - beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in america and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door , you can ' t go wrong with the " birth of the beatles " - - a must for any " real " or casual beatle fan . 
POS this film was great . < br / > < br / > the plot was preposterous . < br / > < br / > the action sequences contrived . < br / > < br / > but , provided you can lighten up enough to laugh , it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger . < br / > < br / > the baddies were more silly than bad . the good guys weren ' t too good . the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes . < br / > < br / > the inclusion of a baby added a good touch . sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise . < br / > < br / > i have to disagree about the acting . it was , on the whole , very good . i really wanted to punch judge reinhold . < br / > < br / > and , after all , isn ' t that the mark of a really good movie , wanting to punch judge reinhold ? 
POS a matter of life and death , what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film . powell and pressburger ' s visual imagination knows no bounds , every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions . the switches between the bold colours of " the real world " to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious , showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is . the final court scene is also fantastic , as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter ( david niven ) ' s operation . < br / > < br / > all of the performances are spot on ( roger livesey being a standout ) , and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful , never has there been a more romantic film than this ( if there has i haven ' t seen it ) . a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is . and jack cardiff ' s cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone , the way he lights kim hunter ' s face makes her all the more beautiful , what a genius , he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting . and the sound design is also impeccable ; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time < br / > < br / > this is a true classic that can restore anyone ' s faith in cinema , under appreciated on its initial release and by today ' s audiences , but one of my all time favourites , which is why i give this film a 10 / 10 , in a word - beautiful . 
POS running man isn ' t a great movie , in fact it ' s kinda silly . but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment . i don ' t see how anyone couldn ' t enjoy this picture , it ' s so silly and over the top , that it almost makes fun of itself . by the way , this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there . 
POS i ' m sitting here nov 2006 and i still can ' t help rave about this movie . arnold ' s best movies came in about a 4 - 5 year span . running man , predator , and total recall ( 1990 ) . all 3 are amazing . the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion . i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall . they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017 , but you can ' t help but snicker at the 80 ' s style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv ' s . also the computer graphics of the " the running man " game show intro would not look like that in 2017 . nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic . not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today ' s movie ' s . i really think that arnold ' s acting is much better than he ' s given credit for . now i would not have elected him governor but that ' s california for you . buzzsaw , dynamo , fireball , subzero are fantastic " stalkers " as well and i find the producers don ' t try to overkill the fight scenes . when the stalker is dead . . . he ' s dead . it doesn ' t go on for 20 minutes each . the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don ' t try and overplay it . i give this movie a 10 / 10 and that ' s coming from someone who doesn ' t enjoy a lot of movies these days . if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you ' d see in 2006 are not important or necessary . 
POS this film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldn ' t work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived . however , if you are the sort person , like me , who adores older hollywood films , you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is - - an interesting soap . < br / > < br / > the film is set in a ward for problem pregnancies . in this large room are about a half dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth - - but doctors are concerned about possible complications ( yikes - - such a room would really traumatize the mothers ! ) . and , like an episode of " love boat " or " fantasy island " , each mother has her own special story . with so many rather extreme and crazy stories , you have to suspend disbelief . i could and enjoyed the film quite a bit . < br / > < br / > here are a few of the stories : one involves a father . you don ' t see the mom , but he is a very , very nervous father and it ' s included for comic relief . however , he was wonderful here - - very touching . < br / > < br / > loretta young and eric linden are a sad case . loretta is sent to the hospital from prison - - she apparently killed some horrible guy . you don ' t know exactly what occurred , but you assume he was trying to force himself on her ! yet , she was given a 20 year sentence - - and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he can . < br / > < br / > glenda farrell is an awful person . she has the maternal instincts of a hamster - - a really , really bad and alcoholic hamster ! she is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film . i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as becoming upset when she learns she can ' t make money selling her twins ! ! late in the film , she has a typical hollywood - style change of heart that was supposed to be touching - - i found it contrived . < br / > < br / > there is a woman who has given birth to a still - born baby . amazingly , afterwords , they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth ! ! ! a crazy woman , who you assumed lost a baby some time ago , wanders down from the psychiatric unit . she insists she ' s having a baby . later , she escapes again and actually takes one of the kids ! < br / > < br / > there are most stories than this but the ones i mentioned are the main ones . as i said , it ' s a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining - - and quite sad in the case of several of the stories . the ending , in particular , is heart - breaking and exceptionally well done . there were a few particularly good performances - - especially farrell and aline macmahon as the head nurse . all in all , a very good film - - and i have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later ( which was typical for warner brothers ) . 
POS i saw this movie yesterday on turner , and i was unable to stop watching until it was over , even though i sort of could guess what would happen . farrell was great in her role , and everyone else did a super job . some of it seemed to stretch the limits , but all in all , i loved it ! ! if you get the chance to see it , please do ! i actually cried at a few scenes , but then i guess if you are a mom you would . loretta is beautiful , and i was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there , it seemed ahead of its ' time . i say , watch it if you can , and don ' t listen to criticisms . as they say , i laughed , i cried ! i thoroughly enjoyed it ! 
POS the waiting womans ward of a large lying - in hospital , with all its joys and sorrows , is the place where life begins . < br / > < br / > this nearly forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera , replete with comedy and tragedy , all tied into the lives of the maternity staff and their patients . the frankness with which the subject matter is handled points up the movie ' s pre - code status . < br / > < br / > marvelous aline macmahon , as the sympathetic head nurse , is the calm center of the film , the rock around which all the currents flow . able to handle any crisis or emergency , she is the mothers ' best , sometimes last , friend . surrounding macmahon is a bevy of excellent costars : loretta young as a convicted murderess released from prison long enough to give birth ; eric linden as her frightened young husband ; brassy glenda farrell as a dame who hates children ; sweet clara blandick as a very mature mother in for her sixth birthing ; preston foster & hale hamilton as thoughtful , compassionate doctors and frank mchugh as a comically frantic father - to - be . < br / > < br / > movie mavens will recognize bobs watson as a wee tyke who wants to see the stork ; paul fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a ` little soldier ; ' gilbert roland as a distraught italian husband and elizabeth patterson as a snooty doctor ' s wife interested in adopting farrell ' s son - all uncredited . < br / > < br / > there are a few absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously much too old ; farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the ward but none of the staff seem to notice ; an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious . 
POS tenchu aka . hitokiri - directed by hideo gosha - starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs ( together with goyokin , hara kiri & rebellion ) to the best chambara movies existing . < br / > < br / > its the story about shintaro katsu ( who plays okada izo ) working for nakadei , who wants to become the daymio . okada , being the " cleaner " for nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to nakadei . < br / > < br / > but there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! < br / > < br / > ( tenchu means heavens punishment ) 
POS it ' s a testament to gosha ' s incredible film - making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece , goyokin , in the same year , 1969 . and it ' s a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public ( compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa ) , that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them . < br / > < br / > shintaro katsu is okada izo : mad dog killer , loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi , played by another genre stalwart , tatsuya nakadai . the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate . the historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with japan ' s increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion . it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate , but it ' s not essential by any means . the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well . < br / > < br / > as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years ( the late 60 ' s ) the visual palette is breathtaking , the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty . style however is never decorative for gosha - it is always employed in the service of story . < br / > < br / > and speaking of story , hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada . as most chambara protagonists , izo finds himself in a moral double - bind , torn between giri ( obligation ) and ninjo ( natural impulse ) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is . in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self - advancement . lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat ' s daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer ' s background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan . < br / > < br / > the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self - advancement comes , the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self . it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a " nameless " drifter without past or future , torazo the vagrant . although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo ' s mold , it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego , ambition and self - dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself . < br / > < br / > hitokiri ends ( which i won ' t reveal here ) in the best way any story can end : both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh , a last sardonic remark in the face of death . 
POS i only saw it once . this happened in 1952 , i was seven , the movie 13 . < br / > < br / > we were so young . . . but i kept in mind , forever , the strong moments of gunga ' s sacrifice . < br / > < br / > i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation . under these historical circumstances , in the movie , the personal relation of friendship , a kind of friendship that ignores itself , the one raised between people who share daily life , who see each other faces , who knows each other names , but belong to different worlds , can only make appears . then , in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges : " whom are we , in first , supposed to be loyal ? " , which people , family , motherland , the person you know close to you ? . you do not have time to give a perfect answer , urgency is there , and it is for life or death . gunga - din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself . somewhere , in a confuse manner , a problem remains unsolved , the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies , just one life , nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today , because this death , this unique vanishing life i lived it , i shared with my child unconditional friendship . it was lived by the spectator i was . that day i loose gunga - din for ever . as i left behind , later , my pretty childhood , as i left from then so many worlds i lived in . i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn ' t expect to do this morning when getting up . 
POS i enjoyed this movie a lot . i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history . there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system . i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better . what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was . throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her , had given her everything , even lost their careers for her . until she had met cortland , she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness . the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible . i ' d recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under - laying meaning of the movie and plot . 
POS lily powers works at a speakeasy until her father dies . she then goes to new york to work at an office building . there she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want . and what men want is her . . . well , you know . alfred e . green ' s baby face ( 1933 ) is a movie of high sexual content . for a movie of that era , anyway . this was one of the last pre - code films that were made . barbara stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as lily . other actors of this film include george brent ( courtland trenholm ) , donald cook ( ned stevens ) , alphonse ethier ( adolf cragg ) , henry kolker ( j . p . carter ) , margaret lindsay ( ann carter ) and theresa harris ( chico ) . the young john wayne is seen as jimmy mccoy jr . this movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good . baby face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch . 
POS finally , the uncut version of " baby face " surfaces and from what source ? the library of congress . the restored four minutes , snippets here and there , make for a much better film . we now know that baby face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age . another reason d ' tat for her behavior and cold , calculating exterior . < br / > < br / > barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers ( notice the moniker ) , a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power , cunning , and revenge , yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for , a very difficult portrayal to make convincing . barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top ( literally ) , she still has good in her heart - - note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as chico ( the marvelous actress theresa harris ) and the old philosopher . and though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful , those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her . < br / > < br / > lily powers fails to understand , at first , that emotions are difficult to ride , that it ' s easy to lose control . one possible result is death . hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral , and it ' s a cold lonely location . < br / > < br / > a word should be said about the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in " baby face " by the elderly philosopher who befriends lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man . " baby face " was released the same year adolf hitler came to power in germany . though it ' s highly unlikely that the semi - literate hitler understood much about nietzsche , he considered himself a nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings . " baby face " serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of nietzsche ' s will to power concept , especially in the final scenes . < br / > < br / > although " you ' ve got the cutest little baby face . " is apropos as a theme for " baby face , " an even more telling and applicable melody is w . c . handy ' s " st . louis blues " played throughout the film , especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes . " st . louis blues " is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values . chico is singing a raw , salacious version of " st . louis blues " when lily , now disagreeing with the lyrics , orders her to stop . < br / > < br / > the restored version of " baby face " makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release . by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy . 
POS this is an astounding film . as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust chavez , we are given the background picture which describes a class - divided society . many of the rich , it appears , have a choice with the people ' s democratic choice , and are willing to use the military for regime change . ' be careful what you say in front of your servants ' is a revealing comment . the head of the country ' s biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president , with us backing , and these young irish film makers have it all on camera . a great film to educate young people about democracy . we see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated , and force used , in the interests of big business , against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people . riveting stuff . 
POS possibly the most brilliant thing about che : part two , as we begin to integrate it with part one in our minds , is that there is no clarification of why che chose to confidentially abscond from cuba after the revolution , no allusion to his experience in the congo , no clarification of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d ' etat , no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across south america , which walter salles has given prominent familiarity . extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions . yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals , to establish involved relationships . he is reasonably unreasonable . che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind . but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men . it is the concept . < br / > < br / > in part 1 , in cuba , the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages , given food and cover , supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution . here , in bolivia , not much understanding is apparent . villagers expose him . they protect government troops , not his own . when he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system , his audience appears uninterested . you cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply . soderbergh shows u . s . military advisers working with the bolivians , but doesn ' t fault the united states for che ' s collapse . che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it . < br / > < br / > in showcasing both wars , soderbergh doesn ' t build his battle scenes as actions with specific results . che ' s men attack and are attacked . they exchange fire with faraway assailants . there is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat , its death toll not paused for . this is not a war movie . it is about one man ' s reasonably unreasonable drive to endure . there is no elaborate cinematography . soderbergh looks firmly at che ' s inflexible dedication . there are remarkable sporadic visceral shots , but being few they are all the more powerful , such as che ' s pov shot during his final beats . there is an abundance of the terrain , where these men live for weeks at a time , and the all - consuming effect is of languor , guevara himself having malaria part of the time . < br / > < br / > benicio del toro , one of the film ' s producers , gives a champion ' s performance , not least because it ' s modest . he isn ' t portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes . in cuba , he arises in conquest , in bolivia , he falls to the reverse , and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair . del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude . you may think the film is too long . i think there ' s a genuine cause for its breadth . guevara ' s affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches , but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane . in the end , che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie , one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means . 
POS it surprises me that i actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks " che : parts 1 & 2 " . why ? because if my cuban exile parents would ever found out i saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the cuban revolution , i would be grounded for life . hey wait ? i am an adult , they can ' t ground me no mas . director steven soderbergh , and newbie commie ( sorry steven , but i had to take soder shots here ) divides the movie in two partes on commander ernesto " che " guevara ' s revolutionary life . " che : part 1 " presents how che in the mid 1950 ' s joined fidel castro ' s guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow cuban president fulgencio batista ' s regime ; which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them , but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many cubans as it revolted into communism . " che : part 2 " presents che trying to revolutionize the t - shirt industry by pitching t - shirts with his appalling bearbado face to t - shirt manufacturers . ok , i am che - chatting a lot of crap towards your way ! i meant to say the ' che : part 2 " focuses on che in the late 60 ' s trying to bring back the revolution , this time to a poverty - stricken bolivia , but with far different results . in fact , che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the bolivian militia in 1967 . soderbergh does not include the in - between time of those two instances in che ' s life when he commanded the despicable la cabana fortress prison in cuba , where he mass murdered many cubans who opposed communism . that is where i think soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious guevara really was . i did decide to see " che " in hopes that soderbergh would not glamorize him , but instead present how disturbed he really was . unfortunately , soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present guevara as a revolutionary hero , which he was not . he was a sick man who thank god is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel . now , i do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that benicio del toro ' s performance as che was extremely commanding , and worthy of merit . and that demian bichir was a haunting dead - ringer as fidel castro in his meticulous performance . but the rest of the cast of " che " was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying guerilla soldiers . and as much as i do admire matt damon , why did sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a spanish - speaking cameo performance portraying a bolivian delegate ? soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly " too much talk and not enough action " in 4 hours and 30 minutes . we have had too much of che already , even posthumously with those ridiculous t - shirts , so why give us too much more of him ? but i guess when you have the del toro by the horns ( as you did here steven ) , i guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing " che : parts 1 & 2 " . * * * average 
POS the very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist , and my thought was : " this is almost too beautiful . " and it goes on like this : images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings , each of them perfect in every detail . even the girl ' s room , her father ' s car - everything is nostalgic , romantic , beautiful . this could seem outdated and escapistic , but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty , happening on the border between life and fairy tale , between dian fossey and le petit prince . i enjoyed every minute of it . the extreme parsimony of the movie , having a simple , slow story , just one actor and hardly any special effects , exerted a strong magic . i therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes , when suddenly two additional actors ( the girl as a grown - up woman , and her son ) are introduced . another shortcoming is the music , which is often intrusive , hollywood - like , and sometimes inappropriate : i couldn ' t bring an english pop - song together with french mountain glory . i went to the movie together with my two small daughters , but i recommend it to adults as well , given that they appreciate this kind of movie . obviously , not everybody does . 
POS maybe it wasn ' t that good as a whole , but the second episode , which was the first one i say , was so memorable i still remember it today . i became a fan of dick francis . i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries . < br / > < br / > the cockney slang of the sidekick , chico barnes , is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing london ' s bow bells , but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting . < br / > < br / > sid halley was one of francis ' more interesting characters , and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand . interestingly , electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after world war ii . 
POS this was stupid funny movie . . cheech and chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever . . . i rate this film a 7 . . but if you like this one then go see jay and silentbob ! there funnier and crazier . now cheech is a sellout working on kids movies . . . . . wheres chong ? 
POS the best cheech & chong movie so far ! ! of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far . i think i ' ve seen them all about twelve times at least , and i love them all . but this is most definitely the best . compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs . part of the texts are still part of our language today , after 25 years . i hope that one day they can make another one , because they still are great comedians . i heard they are writing a new script so who knows . . . i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre . i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them . . . 
POS young beautiful eva ( hedy lamarr ) marries an older man ( zvonimir rogoz ) . unfortunately he can ' t satisfy her sexually and ignores her . frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce . then , one day , she ' s skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods . her horse gallops off with her clothes . . . and she runs after it ! she meets young and very handsome adam ( aribert mog ) . they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants . < br / > < br / > ending spoiler ! ! ! ! naturally , since this was made in 1933 , she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale . end of ending spoiler ! ! ! ! < br / > < br / > this horrified people in 1933 but it ' s pretty tame by today ' s standards . lamarr ' s nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude , it ' s either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such . there ' s only a few minor shots of her breasts . also when she has sex with mog , nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm . these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release . now today they ' re back in . this film would get by with a pg - 13 easily now . < br / > < br / > shock episodes aside this is just ok . it is beautifully filmed and there ' s next to no dialogue . except for the music score this could be a silent picture . luckily all the actors are good - - lamarr and mog especially and they ' re so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them . also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i ' ve ever seen in a movie . the scenes with the sexual symbolism ( there ' s quite a few of them ) are unfortunately pretty obvious today . i actually started to giggle during one ! < br / > < br / > so , great direction , beautiful imagery , attractive actors , good acting all around - - but i wasn ' t exactly bowled over by it . i found the movie slow - moving ( beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me ) , somewhat dull , obvious , static and had a negative ending . i can live with the ending but it doesn ' t excuse the other problems i had with it . also the final sequence is really strange - - and out of place . so i admire this film more than anything else . it was well - done and i ' d recommend it but with caution . many people seem to love this movie so i ' m in the minority . use your own judgment . 
POS i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally . as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema . i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book " film " , which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re - read today . my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin , drifters ( grierson ' s magnificent documentary ) , metropolis , the cabinet of dr caligari , and ecstasy ; came first through this book and later at my university art - house cinema . ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican , for condoning eva ' s desertion of emil , her subsequent divorce , and the brief swim she took in the buff , but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant , outstandingly beautiful , visual paean to love - a view echoed by many imdb users . a very lonely young man , when i saw it , i willingly concurred . no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed . quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial . ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence , against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term ' the lifeforce ' . < br / > < br / > ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong . disappointed , she returns home and divorces him . soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding . she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience . her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing . but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself . after these exciting climacteric sequences , a bland , predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy , collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy . this story is trite , the acting is no more than adequate ; and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage , as did most of its contemporaries , long ago . what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography , a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction , coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important - it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film . it is sub - titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub - titles , and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward . this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch . the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it . for example , the names - eva and adam ; the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him ; the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery ( a bee pollinating a flower , a key entering a lock , a breaking necklace during eva ' s virginal lovemaking sequence with adam , etc . ) ; and the final post - suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society , as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on . < br / > < br / > as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 - even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8 . for me the film will always remain a " must see " , ( although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment ) . unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930 ' s reaction to hedy kiesler ' s very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood ( some critics , who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites , hula , back to god ' s country , bird of paradise or some of the early works of d . w . griffiths and c . b . demille , have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film ) . this scene was probably part of the original novel , and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it . < br / > < br / > two further thoughts ; firstly this is a czech film , released there in 1933 . its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations ( i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film - were they removed from the copy i saw then ? ) . secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime . we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience . 
POS this is my kind of film . i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that . but it is also a dark comedy . while i see it mostly as a horror / thriller , there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy . < br / > < br / > but either way , it is a fascinating descent into madness . the ending caught me off guard , but what an ending ! it leaves the viewer a lot to think about . < br / > < br / > powerful performances , a complex and detailed plot , a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor , and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching . < br / > < br / > personally , i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within . but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do . 
POS i ' m a pretty old dude , old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 50 - 55 years ago , when every taste for a kid was fresh . i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker , so that i could taste those things today . this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how i ' ve drifted , physically and otherwise , a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations . over the half century , they would have had to adjust quite a bit , because you see i would have known that i set them aside . eating one now would be a celebration of self and past , and story , and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward . < br / > < br / > i didn ' t have enough sense to do that with original coke . and i couldn ' t have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then . but i did something almost as good . in the seventies , i really tuned into roman polanski . he was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know , movies smuggled out of the soviet block . movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward . movies that make you want to live with polish women , one , and then deciding that they would be the last to get it . < br / > < br / > here ' s what i did . i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside . i did not watch it . i deferred until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it . over the years , i would test myself , my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it . there probably are few poles who have worked at this , practicing to deserve chopin . working to deserve womanness when i see it . trying to get the inners from the edges . < br / > < br / > recently , i achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out . i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work optimally , because i had already seen and understood " 9th gate . " < br / > < br / > if you do not know this , it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant ( about whom the story is named ) jumped out the window , to die later after this man ( played by polanski ) visits . what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman . we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad . but the way we follow him , he is not . he merely has flashes that the world is normal , and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality . < br / > < br / > the story hardly matters . what matters is how polanksi shapes this thing , both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh . the two never meet . there is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years . its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig . < br / > < br / > i know of no one else that could do this , this sketch that remains a sketch , this horror that remains natural . < br / > < br / > to understand the genius of this , you have to know one of the greatest films ever made ; " rear window . " the genius of that film is the post - noir notion that the camera shapes the world ; that the viewer creates the story . what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out . in rear window , the idea was that the on - screen viewer ( jimmy stewart ) was the anchor and everything else was fiction , woven as we watched . here , the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker . we know this . we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator . we know it is true that bodies shift identity , that times shift , that causality is plastic . we know that the narrator will kill us . we know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror , on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine . < br / > < br / > ted ' s evaluation - - 4 of 3 : every cineliterate person should experience this .

POS riveting drama , scripted by william mastrosimone based on his stage play , in which farrah fawcett plays marjorie , attacked in her car by rapist joe ( james russo ) . she manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do . she realizes , however , that joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives . when her housemates pat ( alfre woodard ) and terry ( diana scarwid ) are off at work , joe pays her a visit to finish what he started . after joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways , she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him . knowing full well she ' s in another " his word against yours " situation and that no rape technically took place , she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to pat and terry what his intentions were . < br / > < br / > the movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents . as it goes on , marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn ' t become as unhinged as her nemesis . fawcett does a creditable enough job , while russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation . with only two characters on screen for much of the running time , the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage . director robert m . young doesn ' t shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation ; the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times . and by the time marjorie has the upper hand , things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood , and one hopes that pat can make her see reason . < br / > < br / > " extremities " , i felt , was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity . woodard and scarwid are both fine in support ( scarwid has a great moment where terry reveals herself to be a rape victim ) , and the pace is consistent . granted , the dialog isn ' t always very sharp , but the material is compelling every step of the way . < br / > < br / > 8 / 10

POS val kilmer . . . love or loath him , sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go ' hey ! this guy is a great actor ! ' he did in the leather pants of jim in the doors and he ' s done it again in the leather underpants of john . < br / > < br / > revolving around the fall and fall of uber porn king john holmes , kilmer strutts to his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries hollywood has never solved for over twenty years , with holmes the key suspect to a brutal manson - style slaughter . < br / > < br / > what kilmer does so effortlessly is exhude the low - life of the celebrity , the do anything to anyone craving that overwhelms anyone who had it and then lost it . go see him , you ' ll know what i mean . 
POS haven ' t seen any of the japanese grudge - films , but i really enjoy this one . i rarely get scared when watching films . i can jump , if the effect and sound is startling enough , but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me . but i did get scared from grudge . maybe because i didn ' t expect anything at all when i watched it . i didn ' t expect getting scared . i didn ' t know anything about it either . that was probably a good thing . < br / > < br / > this is a film that you , apparently , either love or hate . most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge - films , but even though i haven ' t seen them , i believe it isn ' t right to compare any film , actually . this film stands on it its own . < br / > < br / > the story is weak , most people say . i don ' t agree . the story is minimalistic , and done so on purpose . the story - telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done . the director knows exactly what he ' s doing , and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it . < br / > < br / > i gave this film 8 of 10 . it is a film you will enjoy watching , or hate . it ' s as simple as that . 
POS so , being a fairly deep fan of horror movies , it ' s been a while since i ' ve seen one that really made me jump ( or fidget nervously . ) < br / > < br / > definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out . . . a hell of a lot better than the ring . the thing that i don ' t get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible , well , if that ' s what you think , then so be it . . . i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared , so i have to say that this one is worth watching . < br / > < br / > now , you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line , because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story ( i think that if it was shown in chronological order , it would have ruined the whole thing . ) < br / > < br / > i ' m actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it . . . maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don ' t have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid . 
POS i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch ' s works , for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical " lynch - elements . " having seen most of his works , i naively thought i could predict lynch ' s next step . i was dead wrong . dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch . still , after my recovery from the first shock , i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character , and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities , cruelty , brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality , being emphasized by distorting it . there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize , for they are either disgusting or horrible , however , they are surrounding us , so i take the courage to say , dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces . this is not a movie to enjoy , though you ' ll sometimes laugh out of a strange , perverted sense of humor , this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe , with its simplicity , morbidity and absurdity . take it as it is , you don ' t have to like it . it just exists . and finally , if you ' re attentive enough , you ' ll find elements typical to lynch as well . i recommend it for tolerant people ! ! ! 
POS anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of elk hills . the town elders deputize tough , cagey vietnam veteran aaron ( a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by kris kristofferson ) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place . the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over elk hills after they get rid of all the bad elements . it ' s up to aaron ' s decent do - gooder brother ben ( amiably played by jan - michael vincent ) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand . writer / director george ( " miami blues , " " gross pointe blank " ) armitage whips up a delightfully amoral , cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive - in exploitation contemporary western winner : he expertly creates a gritty , no - nonsense tone , keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout , and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb ( the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring ) . the first - rate cast of familiar b - feature faces constitutes as a major asset : victoria principal as ben ' s sweet hottie girlfriend linda , the fabulous bernadette peters as flaky saloon singer little dee , brad dexter as the feckless mayor , david doyle as a slimy bank president , andrew stevens as an affable gas station attendant , john carpenter movie regular charles cyphers as one of the ' nam vets , anthony carbone as a smarmy casino manager , john steadman as a folksy old diner owner , paul gleason as a mean strong - arm shakedown bully , and dick miller as a talentless piano player . moral : don ' t hire other people to do your dirty work . william cronjager ' s slick cinematography , gerald fried ' s lively , harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score , and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy . 
POS this film was just brilliant , casting , location scenery , story , direction , everyone ' s really suited the part they played , and you could just imagine being there , robert redford ' s is an amazing actor and now the same being director , norman ' s father came from the same scottish island as myself , so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film , the witty remarks throughout the film were great , it was just brilliant , so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch , and the fly - fishing was amazing , really cried at the end it was so sad , and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good , and this definitely was , also congratulations to the two little boy ' s that played the part ' s of norman and paul they were just brilliant , children are often left out of the praising list i think , because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film , but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done , don ' t you think ? the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone ' s life after all that was shared with us all . 
POS i used to watch this show as a child , and i loved it ! i watched it when it came on toonami years ago . . . . sheesh , i sound so old ! i must ' ve been 13 or 14 when it came on . . . but anyways , it had a great plot line , and i ' m one of those girlie - girls who watched ( and adored ) sailormoon , and i enjoyed it very much . the animation wasn ' t the best . . . . quite amusing in some parts , actually , and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning , but it was all a good watch , and i found myself sucked into it day after day . < br / > < br / > samurai troopers / ronin warriors is a classic , and an all - time one of my faves . go ryo ! ! ! ! 
POS a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake . as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster . < br / > < br / > recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening . it ' s the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal . its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it . this is a real drive - in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects . the monster , a mix of stop motion and a life size head , is a charmingly quaint little beast . the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem . sure its clear that its all fake , but isn ' t movies about suspension of disbelief ? actually i think its about really cool monsters , which this has . < br / > < br / > i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way . if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther . this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films ( boggy creek etc . ) 
POS this is by far my most favourite movie in the world ! ! ! ! ! i enjoyed it when i was 4 and i still enjoy it at 16 ! ! its an absolute masterpiece ! no video collection is complete without it ! ! ! i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound sheesy but in actual fact the movie is done very cooly in actual fact ! although michael jackson has been in afew movies now , people still dont see him as an actor . in reality he ' s the most talented actor i know ! he ' s so talented ! he ' s incredible ! ! ! moonwalker is a must see ! ! ! ! ! ! 
POS this is without a doubt the funniest of the curly stooges shorts . i ' ve seen it dozens of times and it always makes me laugh . hilarious pantomime sequences . a perfect example of " musical comedy " . even people who don ' t like the knuckleheads remember this one fondly . 
POS this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick " disorder in the court " . this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy . < br / > < br / > the boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of " voices of spring " . she is going to be offered a record deal , but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer . when she and the others leave the studio , the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine . the contract lady who can make christine ' s career , sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party . of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd , so he ' ll find a way to get back at them . < br / > < br / > what a great stooge flick , this should not be missed ! < br / > < br / > 10 / 10 
POS in a little town in montana two brothers grow up . one of them is norman ( craig sheffer ) , the other is paul ( brad pitt ) . their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion , and the lessons of fly - fishing . in this movie fly - fishing represents life , a little . < br / > < br / > the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action . probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen , but about the message . some things do happen though . norman goes to dartmouth to study . after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie ( emily lloyd ) and he is invited to teach in chicago . paul has become a reporter and is known as the " fishing reporter " . he is famous and it seems he has a nice life , but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much . < br / > < br / > the movie is very well directed , it has a nice score and all of the actors are good . the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography . the mountains , the woods and the river all look very beautiful . if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch . fortunately there is more . 
POS can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say " i liked it " ? it ' s reasonably funny by bits , it got great stars and it ' s gorgeous to look at . the songs ( there are about two which are then repeated ) are forgettable , but they get a healthy ironic treatment ( such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered ) ; there isn ' t much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around miss grable , and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed , but the result still is very uplifting . the photography ( including real outdoor shots which are a thrill ) is amazing , playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold . miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side , but still fresh and comfortable in this continental " olde worlde " comedy . it ' s pretty much along the line of " down to earth " with rita hayworth , and that one tends to be rather disliked by many . so i suppose several people would deem " that lady in ermine " to be outdated and stuffy . but it ' s a fairy tale , and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow . my suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork , the costumes , the witty script and everything else this film has to offer , and stop complaining . the film has been released on dvd in germany , with both german and english soundtrack . 
POS excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years . starting around 1910 , he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood ; his family , friends , romances , etc . very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale . . . . " all things in life come together as one , and a river runs through it . and that river haunts me . " worth seeing . 
POS spider - man is in my opinion the best superhero ever , and this game is the best superhero game ever . while it may be somewhat easy , you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers , which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game . it may seem hard to control at first , but once you get the hang of it , you will be web - slinging like spider - man himself . < br / > < br / > the bosses , while like the levels are somewhat easy , are fun . the first boss , scorpion , is incredibly easy to beat , which shouldn ' t be so because as fans of the comic books know , scorpion is one of spider - man ' s most deadly villains . the second boss , rhino , is also very easy . the 3rd boss is venom , who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game , which definately shouldn ' t be . the 4th boss is venom again . this time , he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy . the 5th boss is mysterio , who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game . he is also one of the harder bosses , but once again , still fairly easy . next boss is carnage , who is , you guessed it , easy to beat . but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight . 7th boss is doctor octopus , who is like all the other bosses easy , but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield . the 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game , never in a comic book or cartoon . i won ' t spoil it for you for those of you who haven ' t played the game , but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn ' t too easy . took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries . < br / > < br / > all in all , a very good game . i gave it an 8 out of 10 . the reasons why i didn ' t give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring ( getting all that stuff will take a while though ) , it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show , the bosses are too easy , and they should have used hobgoblin and / or green goblin as a boss , i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air ! they didn ' t use them in the sequel to this game either ! well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider - man movie , so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie . 
POS now i really liked this movie , it was so funny . both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors , i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future . < br / > < br / > akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time , but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch , he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy ' s like this one in the future , john abraham plays his best friend , he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor . i just love john , neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well . < br / > < br / > the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone . 
POS one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens . a remake of priyadarshans 80s malayalam hit boeing boeing , which in turn was a remake of the 60s hollywoon hit of the same name , garam masala elevates the standard of comedies in hindi cinema . < br / > < br / > akshay kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy . he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham . however john still remains in akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion . < br / > < br / > the new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles . < br / > < br / > a must watch comedy . leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs ! ! ! ! after all laughter is the best medicine ! ask priyadarshan and akshay kumar ! ! ! ! ! 
POS ' the italian ' is among the great or near - great films of 1915 that are available today . the year was a turning point for the feature - length film , especially in america : lois weber ' s ' hypocrites ' , cecil b . demille ' s ' the cheat ' and , of course , d . w . griffith ' s ' the birth of a nation ' set new benchmarks for the art . additionally , that year , russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures , ' after death ' and ' daydreams ' . the french serial ' les vampires ' also has its admirers today , although i disagree with them . the emergence of the feature - length film was led by europe , mainly denmark , france and italy , but dominance of this market and , to a degree , the art shifted to across the atlantic in 1915 . < br / > < br / > the most overriding artistic achievement of ' the italian ' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography . there are some picturesque sunsets , mobile framing , including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car , and , in general , there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout . an especially amazing shot is a close - up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close - up , in reference to d . w . griffith ' s ' musketeers of pig alley ' ( 1912 ) . he ' s so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger . < br / > < br / > unfortunately , the cinematographer appears to be unknown . the director , although originally without credit in the film , is now known to have been reginald barker . five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today , but are rather unremarkable . ' civilization ' ( 1916 ) , which he worked on , was a large production , but a deeply flawed movie . by the way , i ' d guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on ' civilization ' also photographed ' the italian ' . < br / > < br / > moreover , the entire production is very advanced for then . venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles ( for romanticized venice ) and san francisco ( for the ethnic slums of new york ) . there are extensive flashbacks , although perhaps one or two too many . i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor , george beban , who is also the lead in the inner , main narrative . the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes , à la the theatre , which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child ' s room , with the opening and closing of window curtains . parallel editing , in - camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly . additionally , beban and clara williams , as his wife , play their parts well . < br / > < br / > on the other hand , ' the italian ' does have a few drawbacks . the film ' s early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama , although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works well  mostly because it ' s supported by the lighting and photography . the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film , enhanced by the stark photography , must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie - going public back then . the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more ; his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italian ' s revenge . in addition , the filmmakers were either medically naïf or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child . aside from the deficiencies in plot , ' the italian ' is exceptionally well made . 
POS i had read an article about dan jansen ' s olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie . i ' m always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events , and this was no exception . < br / > < br / > the background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family ' s closeness and how they positively affected each others ' lives . i can ' t speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie , it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script . however , the spirit of dan and his family is what matters here . < br / > < br / > its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told . i felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end . 
POS i was waiting to see this movie from a long time . it ' s promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it , i really find it was quite well made . most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life . this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon . the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself . the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate . the editing and direction were also good , meghna gulzar really did a good job here . to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance , a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer . 
POS coonskin might be my favorite ralph bakshi film . like the best of his work , it ' s in - your - face and not ashamed of it for a second , but unlike some of his other work ( even when he ' s at his finest , which was before and after coonskin with heavy traffic and wizards ) , it ' s not much uneven , despite appearances to the contrary . bakshi ' s taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race , of course , but moreover he ' s making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film ; blaxploitation almost , though bakshi doesn ' t stop just there . if it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature . but bakshi ' s aims are higher : throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but italians / mafioso , homosexuals , jews , overall new york - types in the urban quarters of manhattan in the 70s , he isn ' t out to make anything realistic . the most normal looking creation in looking drawn " real " is , in fact , a naked woman painted red , white and blue . < br / > < br / > in mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism ( i . e . the " tar - rabbit , baby " joke , yes joke , plus black - face ) , we ' re looking at abstraction to a grand degree . and best of all , bakshi doesn ' t take himself too seriously , unlike spike lee with a film like bamboozled , in delivering his message . this is why , for the most part , coonskin is a hilarious piece of work , where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and , of course , scenes of awkward behavior ( i loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real - life white couple in tux and dress as looking " colorful " and the like ) , are just too much not to laugh at . it ' s not just the imagery , which is in and of itself incredibly " over " - stylized , but that the screenplay is sharp and , this is key for bakshi this time considering , it ' s got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness . < br / > < br / > using at first live - action , then animation , and then an extremely clever matching of the two ( ironically , what bakshi later went for in commercial form with cool world is done here to a t with less money and a rougher edge ) , pappy and randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape , and pappy tells of the story of brother rabbit , who with brother bear and preacher fox go to harlem and become big - time hoodlums , with rabbit in direct opposition to a jabba - the - hut - esquire godfather character . this is obviously a take off on song of the south with its intentionally happy - go - lucky plot and animation , here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is . < br / > < br / > yet bakshi goes for broke in combining forms ; animated characters stand behind and move along with live - action backgrounds ; when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it ' s as bloody as it can get for 1975 ; when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black - face and a dress , he trips in a manner of which not even disney could reach with dumbo ; a boxing match with brother bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow - motion ; archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies , some and some from the 20s that are just tasteless . < br / > < br / > like mel brooks or kubrick or , more recently , south park , bakshi ' s coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought - provocation second . it ' s also audacious film - making on an independent scale ; everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters ( however all based on the theme of the piece ) all serve the thought in the script , where its b - movie plot opens up much more for interpretation . to call it racist misses the point ; it ' s like calling dr . strangelove pro - atomic desolation or confederate states of america pro slavery . and , for me , it ' s one of the best satires ever made . 
POS stephen king was raised on flicks like this . - flicks not films . < br / > < br / > movies like this and ' jeepers creepers ' are " throwbacks " to the good ' ol day drive - in horror flicks . they are meant to be fun , cheaply made and hopefully : a few good scares . < br / > < br / > anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that ' s all this is . . . all it ever will be . < br / > < br / > stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash . - good , fun , trash ! < br / > < br / > if you enjoyed this i recommend : ' jeepers creepers ' ' jeepers creepers 2 ' ' 30 days of night ' ' scarecrows ' ( ' 88 ) ' they live ' ' planet terror ' ' death proof ' and ' halloween iii : season of the witch ' 
POS yes , this is an ultra - low budget movie . so the acting isn ' t award winning material and at times the action is slow - paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie . this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously , explains it and develops a full plot out of it . aside from the vampire story , we get detailed genetics info , legal and law enforcement , martial arts action , philosophical musings , and some good metal music . kudos go to dylan o ' leary , the director / writer / main actor . it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well . i think to appreciate this movie , you have to be well - versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things . there are some great camera work , too , interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack - something i haven ' t seen before , but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulci ' s zombi . the casting is good , in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed . the main vampire also looks perfect for the role . the female victim looks vulnerable . my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick , there should have been more nudity . if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story , this flick is for you . i ' m looking forward to seeing future projects by mr . o ' leary . 
POS while this movie won ' t go down in the annals of great cinema , it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family . the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place . < br / > < br / > the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named , " the hungry bachelors club " . jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open . bill nunn plays a cadillac - loving mystery man who becomes her lover . fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always . micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney . the ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life . this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family . 
POS this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective , more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events , though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston , bowie , travis and crockett . < br / > < br / > the focus here is on jim bowie , played with sharp , cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 . then 65 , he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part . < br / > < br / > puerto rican - born raul julia humanizes gen . santa ana as no one since j . carol naish back in ' 54 had done . however , the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous , vainglorious popinjay - - gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since . he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but , convinced of his own infallibility , he does not heed it . < br / > < br / > alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays : col . william travis . his portrayal is earnest . he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him . < br / > < br / > the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett . in a coonskin cap and carrying ol ' betsy , he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie . with no conviction in the portrayal , the character is reduced to a few stage conventions . < br / > < br / > the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions . we learn that jim bowie was , in the person of santa ana , fighting his own brother - in - law . the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier . " santa ana likes a bargain . " bowie wryly explains . the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill - advised - - a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film " the alamo " . 
POS skippy from family ties goes from clean - cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie . the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave ( using skippy to help out ) . and while the plot is corny and cliche , the corniness ( for example , an evil green fog taking off a girl ' s clothes ) and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious ( and great ) . and of course , there ' s nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who ' s asking what happened to the love song : ) . definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh . and while you ' re at it , make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 - there ' s an " evil rocker " ( as stated on the video box ) driller killer in black leather w / fringe . a must see for cheesy movie fans . 
POS teenager eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music . one day he finds out his hero sammi curr has died , supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music . but eddie has his last record , never released , and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors . before long sammi has revealed he intends to return to life at the local halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once mocked him . < br / > < br / > filled with humour and in - jokes , this is a highly entertaining film . sammi himself is an original horror movie villain , plays on the ' evils of rock music ' obsessions of the 80 ' s . well worth watching . 
POS undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin ' 80 ' s , which admittedly doesn ' t sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub - genre like " hard rock zombies , " " blood tracks , " " terror on tour , " and the especially ungodly jon - mikl thor - starring stinker " rock ' n ' roll nightmare " tended to be . that aside , this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f / x razzle - dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid - 80 ' s teen - targeted scarefest . moreover , the film ' s pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80 ' s heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self - righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil ' s music are very clever and on the money funny ( famed greed decade heavy metal god ozzy osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti - metal tv evangelist ! ) . < br / > < br / > marc price ( the hopelessly dweeby skippy on " family ties " ) gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as eddie " ragman " weinbauer , a geeky , socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who ' s constantly picked on by the stuck - up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at lakeridge high school ( the cruelty and mean - spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy ) . eddie ' s life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol sammi curr ( an impressively whacked - out portrayal by tony fields ) perishes in a hotel fire . hip local disc jockey nuke ( kiss front - man gene simmons in a cool cameo ) hooks eddie up with sammi ' s final , unreleased album , which when played backwards resurrects curr ' s malevolent spirit back from the dead . sammi encourages eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor eddie ' s life the proverbial living hell , only to have meek eddie prove to be a most reluctant would - be accomplice . it ' s up to eddie , assisted by token nice girl leslie graham ( likeably essayed by the lovely lisa orgolini ) , to stop sammi before things get too out of hand . < br / > < br / > ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor charles martin smith ( who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher ) , smartly written by michael s . murphy , joel soisson , and rhet topham , and capably acted by a uniformly up - to - snuff cast , this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty " jump " moments ( an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long - tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight ) , a rousing " carrie " - style high school dance slaughter sequence , a neatly utilized halloween setting , revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business , and a solid central message that you shouldn ' t make a particular over - hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti - establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status . 
POS the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood . although the vo accounts for all of the film ' s lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story . the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story . the choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time . the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result . i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film ' s suspense . the close - ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye . the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot . the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do . worth watching more than once ! 
POS kristine watts ( molie weeks ) is broken apart , missing her lover ; she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past . she hires a stranger ( douglas davis ) and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix . but time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end . < br / > < br / > the first point that impresses in " the cure " is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color . the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes . the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language , in some moments i needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator . the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous . i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen . last but not the least , the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better . my vote is nine . < br / > < br / > title ( brazil ) : not available 
POS by no means a masterpiece , and far from errol flynn ' s best , istanbul still has much going for it . the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography , bring us back to a time long since past . errol flynn does show moments of his past glory , and is ok as jim brennan , a pilot who ' s past comes back to haunt him . the picture is actually a remake of 1947 ' s " singapore " , and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche ' by today ' s standards . also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply " going through the motions " in this picture . many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats , casablanca . while watching the film , i could see many of the similarities , but hey , casablanca has inspired countless imitators , so take that for what it ' s worth . in closing , if you are a fan of flynn , or old fashioned love stories , you might want to give this film a look . otherwise , i ' d recommend casablanca , or the maltese falcon , as a good introduction to some of hollywood ' s classics . . . . 
POS mark frechette stars as mark , a college radical leftist . mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot , and he flees all the way to the desert . he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport , and flies it himself . < br / > < br / > once out flying over the desert , mark spots a car from the air . a young woman named daria steps out , and sees mark circling in the plane . mark swoops the plane very low several times , causing daria to duck or get hit . when he lands , he becomes acquainted with daria , who is strangely charmed by mark ' s aerial highjinks . < br / > < br / > after engaging in soulful conversation for hours , mark and daria get naked , and make love in the sand . but with mark evading the law , they realize that he needs to keep running . so mark and daria ' s brief tryst is quite poignant , because it doesn ' t get to develop into a full - blown romance . < br / > < br / > zabriski point was the eraserhead of the early 70s . both films have a rambling , vague quality , along with complicated meanings and characters . frechette was as reckless in person , as his character was in this film . a few years after making zabriski point , frechette robbed a bank in real life . while serving his prison sentence , mark died an ignoble death . he was killed by a 150 lb . weight , which fell on him when he was weightlifting . < br / > < br / > the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography , and special visual effects . the incredible , slow - motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion , were a stroke of genius . although not as ground - breaking a film as easy rider was , zabriski point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture . i recommend it , for those who like avant - guard films which showcase the upheaval , of the youth rebellion during the early 70s . 
POS a beautiful new print of " zabriskie point " is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter . it ' s time for a full evaluation of the film . let ' s hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful " extras " will be out in the near future . < br / > < br / > i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore . this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a " near - miss " masterpiece . the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late ' 60 ' s los angeles , i lived there then , and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place . kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work . < br / > < br / > the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes . it is forbidden to those under 16 ( or 18 , i can ' t remember ) . i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print . spoiler - - i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut . what appears today seems rather tame by current standards . < br / > < br / > there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film . before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts , etc . antonioni was very daring to do this . i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non - actors mark frechette and daria halprin . this time frechette did not bother me . halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues . < br / > < br / > much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me . one shot is in a different aspect ratio & distorted by the wide screen . of course , there is actual staged footage , but not all that much . < br / > < br / > i ' m still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane . it looks like he really did some of the flying - there ' s no blue screen or double in some shots . < br / > < br / > i hope to get back to see the film a second time . recommended highly to all antonioni fans . 
POS last november , i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival . i have to say that it was a lot of fun . a few tech errors aside , it was a great experience . i loved the writing and acting , especially from the guy that played the lead role . there is a lot of heart in this movie , a lot of wit to . i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done , and they seemed real nice . all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience , and one i ' d definitely recommend . the story was entertaining and cool , as a woman i ' ve been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy , and i could really understand his problems because of it . the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with . the friends in the movie are really well written to , they are realistic . i know people like these , i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk . the whole movie is just real cool , i wish there were more films out there like it . < br / > < br / > - jayden 
POS at last ! a decent british comedy that isn ' t centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a tv series . john ivay ' s film is a psychoactive tale of discovery , dressed in biker gear . the three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives , giving a sensitive , emotional trio of sub - plots to sew the riotous comedy together . the chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments . it feels part withnail and i , part american werewolf in london , and part quadraphenia ( but only because of the bike gangs , and phil daniels ) . in fact , phil daniels ' lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in withnail and i , with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs . this is a great film , particularly for those who ' ve dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past , who will relate to many moments in the film . a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the welsh corner shop , buying munchies while tripping on ' shrooms . this gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud . and you don ' t have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it . but it ' ll add to it if you do . brilliant . 
POS highly recommended ! ! < br / > < br / > a well written , funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour ! ! ! . give it a go , it ' s good to see an independent british movie more than holding it ' s own against the big established studios ! ! definitely worth adding to any film collection . there are scenes in this film that i ' m sure a lot of people will be able to relate to . you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack . i especially enjoyed the orb ' s version of jimmy cliff ' s vietnam and the tower of london ' s take on freebird . < br / > < br / > go on give it a go . . . . . . . . . . . . you won ' t be disappointed . 
POS i saw a preview of freebird at the isle of man tt as i had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle mags . although i was over mainly for the racing , the lure of seeing phil daniels in a motorcycle movie ( yes i love quadrophenia like everyone else ) proved enough to get me away from the beer and partying . at last ! we ' ve done it ! us british have actually made a great motorcycle film ( and no it ' s not like torque ) this is up there with the best of british comedy . mark my words , this is phil daniels best screen performance , and as far as geoff bell is concerned , there ' s a new british legend making his name felt . i loved gary stretch in shane meadows ' fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation . this is a film not just for us bikers , but i think for everyone ( even my girlfriend loved it ) . i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it got at the isle of man . i ' m not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has , ( watch out for the shop ) , as it would spoil the fun , but i would say , go see , enjoy , and have one of the best nights in the cinema you ' ve had in a while . i really think this could well be a cult classic . as they were saying at the tt . . . c ' mon freebird ! 
POS when i saw this movie first , it was long ago on vhs - video . i did like this movie , because it was funny and excitingly . some years ago i saw another movie , called : * andy colby ' s incredible adventure * in this movie were parts of * wizards of the lost kingdom * used in . they called this movie " kor the conquerer " . i began to search for the " kor " - movie many years , because i wanted to see the complete movie , not only the parts which were used in the * andy colby * - movie . no shop had this kor - movie to rent and no shop did know this movie . many years i watched my old vhs - tapes i had at home , and what a wonder . . . i had this movie since many years still at home , but the movie had a different title , because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles . so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching * kor the conquerer again . the music is great during the hole movie , but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment , when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest . the music in the background had some kind of magic . i like bo svenson , and also the boy , who played simon in the movie . both of them did their job very good . manfred kraatz , germany , 26 . 10 . 2004 . thanks to all for reading my comment . 
POS . . . . . . . playing kaddiddlehopper , col san fernando , etc . the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream . i love watching him interact w / amanda blake , or don knotts or whomever - - he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well - - so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn ' t a disciplined , 19 take kind of production . relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there . < br / > < br / > he reminds me of guys like milton berle , benny hill , maybe jerry lewis some too . great timing , ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades , sheer enjoyment about what he was doing . his sad little clown he played was good too - - but in a touching manner . < br / > < br / > personally i think he ' s great , having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from ' 61 or so , it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me . i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so . < br / > < br / > check this out if you are a fan or curious . he was a riot . 
POS i don ' t pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello , but i ' ve never witnessed a performance of the play , on film or on stage , wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity . < br / > < br / > according to the biographical notes , fishburne never received any professional training as an actor . perhaps this explains why his acting , in this beautifully edited film , comes over as so believable and so powerful . instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high - powered roles , fishburne ' s portrayal is focused more on othello ' s love for his wife , and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal , than on violence and vengeance . in a word , the performance is understated , and made far more impressive by fishburne ' s extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been . < br / > < br / > the acting throughout is superb , and the ( abridged ) speeches gain grace from their light editing . ( even shakesspeare , after all , can be improved upon , now and again - - and if that be treason , make the most of it ! 
POS envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be , but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for , now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball , but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever , so the story is about jack black ' s character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear , obviosly ben wants no part of it , but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy , its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt , but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times , as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun , give it a watch 
POS after , i watched the films . . . i thought , " why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office ? " even thought the movie had a clever / unusal scenario , the acting wasn ' t that good and the characters weren ' t very interesting . for a korean movie . . . i liked the fighting scenes . if you want to watch a film without thinking , this is the film for you . but i got to admit . . . the film was kind of childish . . . 6 / 10 
POS alright , this film is the representation of several things . for starters , this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students . one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries . the lead character is what several people who consider a ' loner / goth ' , despite the movie ' s stating of her not being so . she seems quite mysterious , but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom . she ' s questioned , due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before . anyhow , she ' s a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society . yet , due to some , at first unexplained events , she spent roughly a year out of school , failing the grade . she has the desire to graduate , and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor , the girl in the hospital . < br / > < br / > these two leads are nearly entirely opposite , and they are quite that on a social level . while alisha is a quiet , inwardly disturbed , anti - social ' goth ' girl who spends her time entirely alone ( even though she seems to read quite often , somewhat of a closet / out of the closet bookworm ) , the other girl is a rich , popular ' bubbly ' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world , ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive . i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most ' cliques ' in the modern highschool , but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other . while the injured girl learns a deep , meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world , alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing . < br / > < br / > many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things . either , a snobby , hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does , taking it out on an innocent girl , or the story of a seemingly trapped , fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge , but that she is actually , perhaps , one of the most intelligent people she ' s known . in other words , people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life , but it isn ' t about that . < br / > < br / > this film is about several things . while it is about all i have stated , it is also representative of how people deal from a large , life - changing catastrophe . truly , this movie is not very symbolic , but instead incredibly straight forward with its message , as long as you aren ' t afraid to open your mind , and your heart , to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously . < br / > < br / > overall , this film is one of the best i ' ve ever seen . the acting is brilliant , the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful , and the emotion flowing through - out this film will have anyone not only relating , but possibly crying . this film is by far heart - wrenching , and very impactful , and if i ever believed any film could alter a person ' s life . . . this would be the first that could have changed mine . < br / > < br / > i adored this movie , if you ever want a movie that ' s moving and impactful , while incredibly entertaining and real , watch this . 
POS all i can say about the necromaniac / schizophreniac 2 series is . . . if you are even remotely " pc " or don ' t have a seriously messed up sense of humor , then you probably wont get it . as sick and disgusting as this movie is , it really is a comedy and not a " horror " movie at all . if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable , to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it ' s comical , then you must see this to believe it . this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn ' t touch this with a 10 foot pole ( with a condom on the end ) . in my opinion though , the best , most extreme pieces of art come from way underground . if you don ' t stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing , then they reject it . < br / > < br / > i have seen stacks of terrible , boring , z - grade , indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvd - r . i have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars . when a no budget film like these two from ron atkins / john giancaspro come out and blow all of the other " shock " films completely out of the water , you really have to take a second look at the whole indy movie scene . after seeing this , you can really see how much freedom an indy film maker can have when they work on their own . < br / > < br / > the funny thing is , even the other people who saw this movie and " hated it " admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it . i don ' t think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two . so if don ' t take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously , and are able to laugh at a misanthropic , puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped , you have to see this . you may just be able to see it for the stand alone , cult classic that it is . both schizophreniac / schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds . 
POS jack frost is really a cool movie . i mean . . . . its funny . its violent . and very enjoyable . most people say that it is b rated , but that couldn ' t be farther from the truth . it has great special effects and good acting . the only weird thing is of course , the killer snowman . i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late - nineties . most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece . that is , be original and give the viewer what they do not expect . jack frost is very cool . 10 out of 10 . grade : a + . ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost . 
POS this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year . the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted . it is a beautiful thing . there were a lot of quality one - liners . this movie blew uncle sam out of the water ( it was made by tha same people , i think ) 
POS bedknobs & broomsticks is another one of disney ' s masterpieces . it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations . ( a similar concept was used in mary poppins when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art . ) i am mainly rating this film through child ' s eyes because i have not seen it in years . back then , it was one of my favourite films . it was magical and mystical , and the last scenes ( the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle ) were my favourites . there was also a lot of stop - animation used with the spells ( ie , people turning into rabbits ) , which may be a little dated and silly now . ( also , i believe that the film starts off slowly . ) through the eyes of a child , this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film . it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely - forgotten today . 
POS fabulous , fantastic , probably disney ' s best musical adventure . i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative , clever and fun . even despite the silly " flying bed " scenes , the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny . could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine ? i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role . remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppins . < br / > < br / > david tomlinson , though he had few quality movie roles , absolutely shines in this adventure . he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays . blustering , prim and proper englishman - - nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does . it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice . < br / > < br / > the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don ' t capture . i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantine ' s house and she must defend it in any way she can . < br / > < br / > bobbing along , bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny , sea . richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers . all of them are fantastic and worth remembering , portobello road being one of my favorites . < br / > < br / > a great film that still holds up today ! ! 
POS what can i say about a tale such as this ? this magical tale has followed me from my early childhood , evoking warm memories in my heart . the characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene . for example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore . i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums . < br / > < br / > the story line was wonderful . i wanted so badly for landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with mr . brown , and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war . < br / > < br / > i am still a child inside , and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other . this movie is my definite favorite of all times . i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away , and transported into another time . 
POS set during wwii , bedknobs and broomsticks is a fun - filled fantasy adventure for kids , starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who , with the help of three evacuee children and a ' professor of witchcraft ' , thwarts a nazi invasion . < br / > < br / > brilliantly inventive , with loads of laughs , this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters , exciting story and catchy tunes . lansbury is perfect as eglantine , the not - quite - perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime , and her three young co - stars ( cindy o ' callaghan , roy snart and ian weighill ) are equally impressive as the cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty hun . < br / > < br / > the special effects are somewhat dated , but let ' s face it , kids don ' t care too much about these things , so long as they are entertained . and entertained , they will be . with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect , and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry potters , it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism . in fact , only a rather drawn - out musical number set in portobello road mars the film ' s perfection , but with so much else to enjoy , that can easily be forgiven . < br / > < br / > and besides , any film featuring uk television legend bruce forsyth as a ' flash ' harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me . 
POS it ' s really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow , mounties and hockey players . this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks ( the first was " the red violin " ) , far better than all but the best hollywood efforts . < br / > < br / > gustad noble is anything but that ; he is a middle - aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s . this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family , his friends and his work , and their effect on him . at the same time , it is a fascinating , and , i would assume , accurate , portrayal of middle - class , urban life in india at the time . < br / > < br / > however , i was somewhat prepared for this , having read rohinton mistry ' s book a few years ago . the film , as might be expected , cannot capture all the complexities of the book , but , if you want to read a really good book , and see a really good film , read and see " such a long journey " . 
POS when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool , i was excited ( it ' s been a personal favorite for years now ) , and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism . having just seen it though , i was surprised to find that it worked , while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool . the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb . . . especial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast , right down to henry ' s son , who was only four in the original . like i said though , this movie is quite different from the first , but it works : i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended . in this case , an unexpected adventure ensues . . . and that ' s about all i ' ll give away . . . not to mention the fact that i ' ll need to see it again to really understand what ' s going on and who ' s double crossing who . while it was certainly one of the better movies i ' ve seen in some time , it suffers like many sequels with its ending , as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging . i ' ll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ( ' henry grim ' ? ) in 2017 . 
POS this really is a great movie . some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever . but basically , all of fred and ginger ' s movies are the same . after the singing and dancing is over , it ' s the other characters in the movie who make the movie work . what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott ? his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again . he adds to this movie , he doesn ' t detract from it . he has a winning personality and a great smile . randy is in my top ten all time favorites list . it ' s great to see him as something other than a cowboy . ok , so he isn ' t really a great actor , but like so many other stars : errol flynn , alan ladd , victor mature , etc . he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions . all of fred and ginger ' s movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers , otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour . i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him . 
POS dog days is one of most accurate films i ' ve ever seen describing life in modern cities . it ' s very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it ' s very close to reality . isolation , desperation , deep emotional dead ends , problematic affairs , perversion , complexes , madness . all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today . it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society . < br / > < br / > the negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly . i only wish it was a lie . unfortunately , it isn ' t . therefore . . . 10 / 10 . 
POS this documentary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing . i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel . i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd . the film footage doesn ' t look all blurry and choppy like you might think from 1925 b & w silent film . set in iran in 1925 , the nomadic tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river , men , women , children , animals . . . then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot . it is sink or swim and climb or die . in search of grass for their animals . they have cows , goats , dogs , horses , mules . in one scene a man is carrying a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain . the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy . they had such a hard life . i wonder if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this . makes you appreciate modern life in usa . 
POS the story is quite original , but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars . its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too , but the actual stealing should ' ve been more in picture . . . however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see ( 7 / 10 ) 
POS as much as i like big epic pictures - i ' ll spare you the namedropping - it ' s great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes . films where the plot takes a backseat to the set - pieces . films where the dialogue isn ' t so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose . there are hundreds of films that fit the bill . . . but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones . < br / > < br / > it ' s an update of the movie that shares its name . it also shares that picture ' s ethos , but not quite it ' s execution . whatever was great about the original has been streamlined . whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget . often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug - ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it - but here , thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors , sixty succeeds . < br / > < br / > the plot and much of the dialogue isn ' t much to write imdb about . often you ' ll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors , each of whom will voice it with different inflections . a lot of people found this annoying ; i find it raises a smile . each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here , with cage , jolie and duvall leading the pack of course ( and it should be noted that it ' s also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here ) . the chemistry between good ol ' saint nick the stalwart ( see date of review ) and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments . < br / > < br / > the villain is not even a little scary - i ' ve seen chris eccleston play tough - guy roles before so i know he can handle them , but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action . we know the heroes are going to succeed , somehow ; we ' re just sitting in the car with them , enjoying the ride . i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in - cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating . in fact , i wouldn ' t have minded some fourth - wall breaking winks at the camera : it ' s just that kind of movie . < br / > < br / > all this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed * just * so - would be worthless if the action wasn ' t there . and for the most part , it is . wonderfully so . i ' ve noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast - cut extreme close - up shots to direct action these days . i personally find this kind of thing exhausting . i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time . i ' ve been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance ( in real life i mean - his character clearly doesn ' t care ) and it shows . the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow - burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and fun - way possible . < br / > < br / > so yes , this movie isn ' t an " epic , life - affirming post - 9 / 11 picture with obligatory social commentary " effort . the pacing is uneven , some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line . but car movies rarely come better than this . so if you hate cars . . . why are you even reading these comments ? ! < br / > < br / > i ' d take it over the numerous iterations of " the flaccid and the tedious " ( guess the franchise ) any day . 7 / 10 
POS to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip ( giovanni ribsi ) , a car thief , who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars ( 50 in total ) . he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the  order ' . the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days , with the help of randall ( nicolas cage ) , a  retired ' booster and also kip ' s brother and a couple of old friends of randall ' s . as you can see this is the same old , big bro ' needs to get lil ' bro ' out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was . of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of , but at times it is predictable too , so there is nothing fancy about the story . < br / > < br / > you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff , since there are only 50 beautiful , fast , cool and expensive cars to be stolen . well the other hot item in this film is sway ( angelina jolie ( who will be a big star ( trust me ) ) ) . she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft , but she is pretty hot too . ok not hot as in pretty , but hot as in damn cool and sexy . she was very believable in this role , probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too ( don ' t believe me , read her biography ) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man . i only know , that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film , because she is not too mainstream , a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo . < br / > < br / > ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was , that there is not very much action , there is one totally unrealistic scene , the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes . hey but after seeing the whole film i must say : who cares . why must i say that , well because it was still entertaining ; had a couple of cool car chases ; good music ; some bruckheimer scenes ( where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet ) ; good actors who all did their jobs ; pretty cars ; one cool , wild , sexy lady ( yes , i mean mrs . jolie ) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with . so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie . all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood ending . < br / > < br / > as for nicolas cage , well he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock , con air , face / off , snake eyes and finally this one . plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller ' s in the last years and such successful ones ? well no one ! ! ! maybe jackie chan , but he is one of my favourites too . one thing that is true though about mr . cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse . the rock , was a clear 9 , con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7 . not that that mark is bad . does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? no it doesn ' t show us that , because almost all of cage ' s films were successful in the last few years , except for 8mm and bringing out the dead . 8mm was not great , i admit that , but that was never cage ' s fault and the story seemed good to me . about the latter film i can not say anything ,  cause i have not seen it yet . one thing though i know for sure , if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films , i would have said yes to all of them . i would have said yes to the rock , because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris . i would have said yes to con air , because there would be a lot of action in it , because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames . in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque , i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie ( can ' t wait to see her in that lara croft outfit ) . this one was a good choice of mr . cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre . < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 
POS went to see this as me and my lady had little else to do on a sunday afternoon i like films that deal with sleazy , loser characters and this is full of em . after a slow start we get some good turns from the cast but it is the actual ' bellini ' that both makes and lets the film down . the ' bellini ' is one of the funniest scenes i have seen in a film for a long while but is too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall 71 / 2 out of 10 
POS this movie is good for tv . i like it because i ' m a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film . accuracy on the film from the book is half - and - half they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser , the the car scene involving the hatch family running away from the tornado wasn ' t in the book instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety . and in the book dan and his friend are both 12 - years old . thats all i can think of . overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book . did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small nebraska town in 1980 ? 
POS first an explanation on what makes a great movie for me . excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time i watch it ( case en point : twister ) . there are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor ( john candy in uncle buck and the great outdoors ) , good plot with good resolution ( madeline and matilda ) , imaginative storytelling ( all star wars episodes - george lucas is the man ) , and good music ( again all star wars episodes , wizard of oz , sound of music ) . what makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a dvd or vhs tape ? characters . with that said , i present cindy lou who and the grinch . excellent performance taylor momsen and jim carrey . the rest of the cast was very good , particularly jeffery tambor , bill irwin , molly shannon , christine baranski , and josh ryan evans . but , every single scene with cindy and the grinch - together is excellent and very funny and / or heartwarming . cindy lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon . the grinch has a strong plot , good conflicts , and a very good theme ( i can ' t get started because i don ' t want to spoil it ) . jim carrey was very funny as the grinch - particularly when he interacted with cindy . and the music ! wow ! excellent music by james horner . i loved his selection of instruments and the compositions . very good job jim carrey - i didn ' t know you could sing . taylor momsen ! whoa ! your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once . on your solo - where are you christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds ? sounds like an f # ? that is an obscene range for a 7 - year old ( obscene meant in the best possible way ) . great job . this is the best performance by a child i have ever heard in a movie ( taylor beat out the von trapp children - no small feat ! ) . and now to the actors . jim carrey was great , funny , and , surprisingly very sensitive ( this really showed through in his scenes with taylor momsen ) . taylor momsen ' s unspoken expressions ( one of the secrets to a good acting performance ) are very strong - she really becomes cindy lou who . and when she does dialogue she is even stronger . < br / > < br / > * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * danger : spoiler alert * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * < br / > < br / > examples : expression when she first sees the grinch . this is a classic quote ( " you ' re the the the " and then filled in with the grinch line " da da da the grinch - after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by the grinch ) . the " thanks for saving me " quote and subsequent response by the grinch was also very good . < br / > < br / > my favorite part of the movie is when cindy invites the grinch to be holiday cheermeister . this scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other . little taylor momsen completely holds her own with jim carrey in this spot . i sincerely hope we see taylor momsen in many more films to come . all in all everything was great about this movie ( except maybe the feet and noses ) . 
POS atlantis was much better than i had anticipated . in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age . although this film did demand a solid attention span at times . it was a great film for all ages . i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure . i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies . a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies . after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis . 
POS " atlantis " is a new and right step for a disney feature . it ' s a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like " atlantis " . i didn ' t have any expectations for this film , but after watching it , i don ' t quite understand why this film got so bad reviews . even in my country the reviewers weren ' t positive . < br / > < br / > " atlantis " is not a perfect movie , but still one of disney ' s greatest , even i doubt that this film ever will get " disney classic " reputation . well , that ' s another case . it ' s funny to think that this sci - fi movie was directed by the same directors as " beauty and the beast " and " hunchback " ( so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation , he he , i ' m just kidding ) . < br / > < br / > well , enough nonsense . " atlantis " is a watchable , exiting and very enjoyable film . even this film it ' s a pg - rated action - feature , it ' s also suitable for kids , in my opinion ( parents who mean the opposite , don ' t kill me for writing this , he he ) . < br / > < br / > the story is a little predictable , but it doesn ' t ruin the movie . the comic book - inspired animation it ' s suitable for the film and set ' s a departure from the usual disney - style . it ' s colorful , dark and detailed . the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive . the film is also funny sometimes , even i more giggled than laugh through the movie . ( spoilers ) the characters of this film are also very likable , but unfortunately there isn ' t enough screen time to get to know everybody , so some characters are left behind ( spoilers ) . < br / > < br / > the score of james newton howard is absolutely great . it ' s daring and exotic . ( spoiler ) the most impressive about this film is how they ' re making the atlantean language sound very natural , ethnic and authentic . it ' s really awesome ( spoilers over ) < br / > < br / > the script is tight and well - written , but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story . but luckily there are not so much of them . < br / > < br / > so do you ' re self a favor , don ' t listen to the reviewers and watch " atlantis " , cause it ' s waiting for you . . . 
POS passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever . you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one . this film for some reason hasn ' t received its credit due . first , lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt . when a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure . mix in a polish translator , a comatose mother , a crack - head with turrets syndrome , a twisted homosexual hypnotist , and one drag queen , money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies . my favorite character in this film would have to be the sister / crack addict with turret ' s syndrome , her sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks . 
POS i ' m certainly glad that a film was made about carl brashear ' s amazing life story . coming as it did during the civil rights era , brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected . < br / > < br / > brashear as played by cuba gooding , jr . leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen . very similar to jackie robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct . as brashear , gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father carl lumbly has and lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he ' s gotten . < br / > < br / > but while harry truman integrated the armed services after world war ii , the navy still has its restrictions . a black man can only be a cook or an officer ' s valet , the real fighting parts are denied him . that ' s not good enough for gooding who applies to become a navy deep sea diver . < br / > < br / > once at the diving school at bayonne , new jersey , gooding gets it all thrown at him , mostly by the master chief petty officer in charge , robert deniro . deniro may have some leftover prejudices , but he ' s nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide . < br / > < br / > the best thing about men of honor is the chemistry between deniro and gooding . they certainly come from different places , but as they get to know each other , both turn out to be men of honor . < br / > < br / > other good performances to note are charlize theron as deniro ' s wife and hal holbrook as the head of the diving school , a guy the navy just wish would retire for reasons you ' ll see . < br / > < br / > men of honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change . 
POS " men of honor " - true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver ( fabulous cuba gooding jr . ) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it ' s part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema . wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable , splendid experience . charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough , fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday - role is practically written for him . this film alongside with fantastic " 15 minutes " ( 2001 ) are two of the latest proofs that he ' s still one of the very finest actors of our time . on the other hand " men of honor " includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr . who has been one of the most promising young black actors since " boyz n the hood " . " men of honor " goes straight into the company of " jerry maguire " , " as good as it gets " and " instinct " . cuba gooding jr . is a skillful and fantastic actor and i ' m prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him . " men of honor " has also quite an excellent story - line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history . this is a great , fascinating movie and i can only recommend it . 
POS it is a superb swedish film . . it was the first swedish film i ' ve seen . . it is simple & deep . . what a great combination ! . < br / > < br / > michael nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown . < br / > < br / > frida hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on & never give up . < br / > < br / > the fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with michael when his wife confronts him and defends michael ' s noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music . < br / > < br / > the only thing that i didn ' t like was the ending . . it wasn ' t that good but it has some deep meaning . 
POS the line , of course , is from the lord ' s prayer - " thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven " . sweden , especially its far north , is not my idea of heaven - 30 degree c winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me , but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in god ' s own country . < br / > < br / > the storyline here is a familiar one . acclaimed international musician daniel suffers health breakdown in mid - career , goes back to the little village in northern sweden where he was born . persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir , he turns some unlikely talent into a class act , and they enter a contest held in innsbruck austria . there are echoes ( sorry ) of the band players of " brassed off " the models of " calendar girls " and the dancers of " the full monty " . but of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors . he faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor , but nothing except death is going to stop him . < br / > < br / > despite the somewhat corny story , we get to know and like many of the characters , who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable " types ' . i did wonder about the wife - beater being unpunished for so long  sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly discouraged ( he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of daniel ' s youth ) and the puritanical pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype , but marvellously realised by niklas falk . < br / > < br / > michael nyqvist is simply wonderful as daniel , the frail but driven musician , and there ' s some nice music as well . i was rapt for the whole two hours . the ending is what you make of it , i guess , but it ' s not spoiling it to say daniel achieves what he set out to do . 
POS i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles . however , i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film . the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes . a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features . i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias , discrimination and sanctimonious pretence . an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen . 
POS first i was caught totally off guard by the film ' s initial lyricism and then i became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and engrossed with the brilliant directing . the characters were all fully developed , not bigger - than - life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world , in sweden , in turkey or in america , all completely believable human beings with foibles and nobility . hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film . it shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright , and that shows the brilliance of the director ! hearfelt thanks to kay pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat ! ! 
POS i really loved this movie and so did the audience that i saw it with in los angeles . after the film , lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them . i can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland , sweden . the film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them . the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring . would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see - even people who don ' t normally go to subtitled films . definitely deserved the oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small - town community with everyday people . it is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit . a must see ! 
POS this is a pretty ok film . . . yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient , and the movie doesn ' t really justify the large star cast ( ab , sd , tanuja ) . however , the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon ( not to be confused with the singer kk ) . in the scene where he first meets amitabh ' s character , i thought that a man who can just look at ab , keep staring and not say a word , and still look strong , is definitely a good actor . in fact , he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar , alongside ab for a second time . this guy should get more roles , he ' s brilliant . < br / > < br / > if you ' ve read any of the other reviews here on imdb , you already know the plot , and i do agree that akshaye khanna ' s entry into pakistan was a little too easy . and the little love angle he shared with " what ' s - her - face " was completely unnecessary . but he is a fairly good actor ( as seen in dch ) , sunjay dutt is cool to watch , always . and ab . . . what can i say . i don ' t know if i ' m his biggest fan in the world , but i know i can definitely compete for the spot . < br / > < br / > an interesting watch , considering it ' s bollywood , although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like " the great escape " and " bridge on the river kwai " . 
POS ' five days ' is billed as something special , a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes , each set on one particular day of a police enquiry . but in fact , this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought , as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable , and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories . in fact one almost can ' t help drawing comparisons to the last ' prime suspect ' , as one of the sub - plots focuses on a single , cynical female cop approaching retirement : and it ' s not just the absence of helen mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable . there ' s a lot of earnest over - emoting , manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic , in another suspicious . and it ' s possible to guess the guilty party well before the end , not because of the internal dynamic of the story , but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole : certain things must be true , to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times . in spite of these failings , the series grew on me : by the end , i was quite gripped . but it ' s a sad sign that the bbc , which once made the likes of ' the singing detective ' , boasted of this of " possibly the best drama of the year " : for there ' s little true originality on offer here , and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing . ' five days ' is in fact not rubbish ; but it is formulaic , and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh . 
POS after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making . the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project . it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian ( ken burns ? ) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone . with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced , an updated version of this series would be welcome . the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original . if you are interested in this era don ' t miss this series . it is required viewing . 
POS although too young to remember the first showing of the series ( being just a baby ) i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80 ' s , just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects . it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests , relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific . since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era , with mixed opinions . the british television stations are generally very good at producing these , as the world at war can easily attest , with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies . i strongly recommend such titles as " the nazis - a warning from history " , " blitz " and the bbc series about dunkirk . " britain at war in colour " , with its companion series " japan " , " germany " and " america " are of a very high standard . the world at war is by far the best and , despite its age , never fails to deliver . there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren ' t included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other , even if such an undertaking was even possible . what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can ' t physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable . that certainly worked for me : i now have a very comprehensive library of books , videos , dvds and tapes and cds . recommend to anyone with even a passing interest . the series was so well made that they ' d find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative . 
POS utterly brilliant . powerful and evocative . the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war . it ' s tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung - ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits . rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war , it allows sir laurence olivier ' s quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war : corpses everywhere , explosions , terrified citizens and soldiers , broken men , indifferent politicians , mistakes that cost thousands of lives , the suffering of the innocents . most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of " civility " are removed . there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature , he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on . perhaps there could be a follow up series called " the century at war " for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors . i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this . 
POS this film isn ' t just about a school shooting , in fact its never even seen . but that just adds to the power this film has . its about people and how they deal with tragedy . i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them . the acting is superb . all three main actors ( busy phillips , erika christensen and victor garber ) are excellent in their roles . . . i highly recommend this film to anyone . its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it . it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy . it is a tear - jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again 
POS i almost didn ' t rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways . i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked . the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station . they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy . it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary . the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be . the make - up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one . it was a simple story with believable acting . it ' s not the scariest or goriest movie , but i wasn ' t ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it . on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i ' m gonna check them out . 
POS hello . i just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days . i am a history teacher that has wayyyyy too much time on my hands . i need a life . i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain . i also found that i look a lot like jean lafitte if he were white . also , my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr . petey - - " this baby can shoot a chipmunk ' s eye from 300 yards ! ! " oh , and my favorite scene in the movie was when the british were coming in , and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work , and he drummed till the death , as if that drum would end the war altogether . . . . but it wouldn ' t . well , thats all i would like to say about this movie . oh , one more thing . . bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging beeyotch . that is all . 
POS in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual " revolution " ( purposefully i use quotations for that word ) , jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic , damning critique of those who can ' t seem to get enough love . if there is a message to this film - and i ' d hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben - hur length feature has to offer - it ' s that in order to love , honestly , there has to be some level of happiness , of real truth . is it possible to have two lovers ? some can try , but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want , or feel they can even express to say what they want ? < br / > < br / > what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre ( jean - pierre leaud ) has with the women around him ? he ' s a twenty - something pseudo - intellectual , not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman , marie ( bernadette lafont ) slightly older than him and is usually , if not always , his lover , his last possible love - of - his - life left him , and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street , veronika ( françoise lebrun ) , who perhaps reminds him of her . soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film , where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures . at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre , but we ' re mistaken . the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around , talking on and on , for something to sink in . < br / > < br / > we ' re told that part of the sexual revolution , in theory if not entirely in practice ( perhaps it was , i can ' t say having not been alive in the period to see it first - hand ) , was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions . but eustache ' s point , if not entirely message , is that it ' s practically impossible to have it both ways : you can ' t have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with " f * * * ing " , as the characters refer over and over again . < br / > < br / > the mother and the whore ' s strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity , the lack of monogamy , while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you ' ve ever seen in a movie . at the same time we see a character like alexandre , who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it ' s about some movie he saw or something bad from his past , eustache makes it so that the film itself isn ' t pretentious - though it could appear to be - but that it ' s about pretentiousness , what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws , what they need to use when they ' re ultimately alone in the morning . < br / > < br / > if you thought films like before sunrise / sunset were talky relationship flicks , you haven ' t met this . but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have , sometimes trivial , or ' deep ' , or sexual , or frank , or occasionally extremely ( or in a subdued manner ) emotional , it ' s never , ever uninteresting or boring . on the contrary , for those who can ' t get enough of a * good * talky film , it ' s exceptional . while his style doesn ' t call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand , eustache ' s new - wave touch is with the characters , and then reverberating on them . < br / > < br / > this is realism with a spike of attitude , with things at time scathing and sarcastic , crude and without shame in expression . all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can ' t ever perceive them as ' faking ' an emotion or going at all into melodrama . it ' s almost too good in naturalistic / realism terms , but for eustache ' s material there is no other way around it . luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period , and both ladies , particularly labrun as the " whore " veronika ( a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film ' s climax of sorts in one unbroken shot ) . and , as another touch , every so often , the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought , of a character sitting by themselves , listening to a record , and in contemplation or quiet agony . this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch , who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely ( and lovingly ) in approach from the late parisian . < br / > < br / > sad to say , before i saw broken flowers , i never heard of eustache or this film , and procuring it has become quite a challenge ( not available on us dvd , and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries ) . not a minute of that time was wasted ; the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work , one of the best of french relationship dramas , maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i ' ve seen from the country in general . it ' s complex , it ' s sweet , it ' s cold , it ' s absorbing , and it ' s very long , perhaps too long . it ' s also satisfying on the kind of level that i ' d compare to scenes from a marriage ; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film ' s release . 
POS i ' ve seen this movie , when i was traveling in brazil . i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society , because it has so many regional and class differences . to see this movie in sao paulo itself was a revelation . it shows something of the everyday life of many brazilians . on the other side , it is sometimes a little bit over - dramatized . and that ' s the only negative comment i have on this film . it ' s sometimes too much , too much sex , too many murders and too much cynicism for one film . the director could film some things a bit more subtle , it would make the film more effective . < br / > < br / > despite this i liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself . the characters are complex , and very much like real - life people . not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics , but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time . that makes the film realistic , even when the story is not that convincing . 
POS i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed : " a scanner darkly " and " immortel ad vitam " . if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed ( like me ) , you will probably enjoy renaissance . it immerses you into the world of a future paris . it is not quite dystopian . they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped , but from what i can tell , it was not , it was merely motion capture . the facial expressions are amazing ! not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation / live hybrid . the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene ; my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams , watch for it . the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find . the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises . < br / > < br / > the plot is secondary , but it isn ' t terrible . it is noir - ish . there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth . there is weather . there are " sets " so you can feel like you are in different places in paris . there is some action , and even a car chase . i am going to have to see this one again to get everything . i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the " sets " are detailed and the credits are small . 
POS there ' s about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it . beginning with existential themes of blade runner , as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products , to the technology of the later matrix films and spielberg ' s a . i . , and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of sin city . the creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo - noir . add a detective story and you ' ve got an interesting film . i know what it wanted to be , but regardless of the stunning visuals , it wasn ' t enough to get it to the final destination . 
POS story says that on that on december 28 , 1895 , a small group of thirty - three people was gathered at paris ' s salon indien du grand café to witness the cinématographe , a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named august and louis lumière . the small audience reunited that day ( some by invitation , most due to curiosity ) didn ' t really know what to expect from the show , and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen , most thought that the cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slide - show projections . until the photograph started to move . what those thirty - three people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen ; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day . < br / > < br / > of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day , " la sortie des usines lumière " ( literally " exiting the lumière factory " ) was the very first to be screened . the film shows the many workers of the lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory , leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work . while a very basic " actuality film " ( movie depicting a real event ) , the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise , as their concept of moving pictures was limited to edison ' s " peep show " machines ( the kinetoscope ) , the brothers ' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe , as the people and the horses moved across the screen . the idea wasn ' t entirely new ( le prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 ) , but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary . < br / > < br / > " la sortie des usines lumière " would become the first in the long series of " actuality films " that the lumière would produce over the years . this primitive form of documentary was the brothers ' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the cinématographe could have . despite the initial lack of enthusiasm , after the first showing the cinématographe became a great success and " la sortie des usines lumière " quickly became an iconic image of that first screening . it definitely wasn ' t the first movie the brothers shot that year , and it probably wasn ' t the best of the 10 movies shown that day ( personally i think that " l ' arroseur arrosé " was the best of the 10 ) ; however , it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates , as literally , this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it . 8 / 10 
POS i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it . geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther . kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven . this film also introduced me to william h . macy , who is now one of my favorite actors . hank was great as the blue raja , and i especially loved that the character wasn ' t really british . the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes . i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball . some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr . furious ' s false rage , and the fact that his threats and one - liners were all gibberish , and that they never made any sense . i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said " fraculater , freinken - puss , " was said . but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie . i highly recommend this film for any occasion , and i give it my own personal two - thumbs - up . 
POS melissa joan hart shines ! this show is amazing ! ! there is no match . except for maybe melissa in clarissa explains it all . she was marvelous in that , too . this is so much better than buffy , the vampire slayer . this show is wonderful ! 
POS everyone has already commented on the cinematography ( good to great ) , the personalities ( larger than life ) , the structure ( chronological , with many references to surf culture through time ) . what is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance : chucking mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding . < br / > < br / > i was a surfer in the 1970s . we used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in socal . i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat , putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night . often , the narrator was the filmmaker himself , reading a script off sheets of paper . sometimes , a surf band or proto - punk band would add music . i was never happier . except for the hooting and hollering , seeing ' riding giants ' took me back in time . < br / > < br / > it also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge , not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder , not keeping up with the joneses , pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question , " what is the purpose of life ? " at least for those like greg noll , laird hamilton and the like , they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue : to live life solely on our own terms . maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life , but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams . < br / > < br / > it was this message that really impressed me . 
POS one of my favorite shows in the 80 ' s . after the first season , it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast . deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine ' s character go at it with each other . the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season . unfortunately during those days , blacks did not last long on television shows . some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show . when it went to usa , it was disgusting ! ! ! 
POS * * * * spoiler alert * * * * all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney . it ' s under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton , richard chamberlain , got involved in a case , as a defense attorney , involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar . < br / > < br / > having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormans , athol compton , death it ' s determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders . yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder . < br / > < br / > david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what ' s coming to them from the court . one of the defendants chris , david gulpili , begin to somehow invades david ' s dreams as if he want ' s to tell him what was really behind billy ' s death . < br / > < br / > david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse . chris confirms david ' s dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams . later meeting chris and , what turns out to be an aborigine shaman , charlie ( nandjiwarna amagula ) who came to his house that evening david is told that he , like charlie , has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother ' s grandfather . those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent . the earth , chris tells david , is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it ' s place . < br / > < br / > david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen . david want ' s to know if it ' s all aborigine folklore or there ' s some scientific facts , or logic , behind their end of world - like revelations . < br / > < br / > by now it ' s obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney . that alone can get chris off , as well as his four friends , for the murder of billy . since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines , leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves . still chris refuses to admit he ' s a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy ' s death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days . < br / > < br / > david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris ' silence , and why billy had to die , is taken by chris to the scene of the crime . it ' s there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris ' tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris ' s aborigine tribe . it ' s also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his step - father rev . burton , david parslow , told him . < br / > < br / > the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david ' s been seeing in both his night - time dreams and day - time visions . it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent . 
POS if you like " othello , " you ' ll love this flick since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play . < br / > < br / > the film has a great cast with signe hasso and shelley winters as the women in colman ' s life while edmond o ' brien plays the enterprising press agent . < br / > < br / > a couple of the supporting players i particularly liked were millard mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle and joe sawyer , the 1940 ' s answer to drew carey , who plays the cop on the case . < br / > < br / > great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout . 
POS i spent 5 hours drenched in this film . nothing i have ever seen comes close to the delicious funk this film left me in . never mind females advanced aging dilemma ' s , human fear vaults off the screen for your viewing . personally engaging to the ninth degree , the film invests one with an undeniable shared feeling for our lives ' . i enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within . it empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain , isolation and skewed views of self and others . the result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter . the birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit . the effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture . 
POS in what must be one of the most blood - freezing movies ever , a transvestite is murdering people in new york , and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect . one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff . michael caine plays a most thought - provoking character , while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo . keith gordon ( who later starred in " christine " ) is probably the most interesting character in the movie . but you can ' t really understand this movie without seeing it . and after seeing it , you may never know just whom you can trust . also starring nancy allen and dennis franz . 
POS a very silly movie , this starts with a soft porn sequence , ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery , adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason . < br / > < br / > what follows is bizarre and surreal ( the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary ) , culminating in a revelatory " twist " ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer ( see the trivia section for precisely why it ' s deliberately unfair ) . < br / > < br / > the movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals , the insane , and the wonderful " huggie bear " - style racial stereotyping on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes , as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film . though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch . < br / > < br / > in fact , the whole movie is a joy to watch : despite its many , many flaws , the whole package just , well , works . 
POS dressed to kill starts off with kate miller ( angie dickinson ) having a sexually explicit nightmare , later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr . robert elliott ( michael caine ) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage . kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger , they go back to his apartment for casual sex , when done kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman . prostitute liz blake ( nancy allen ) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape . detective marino ( dennis franz ) says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate ' s son peter ( keith gordon ) to track down the real killer , clear liz ' s name & see that justice is done . . . < br / > < br / > written & directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery . the script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character ' s so you really know them , the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off , then the film switches it ' s attentions to liz & no one else gets a look in . this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing & engaging , unfortunately the character ' s themselves aren ' t exactly likable . i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times , especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally . the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you ' d have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill . it ' s a good film but it didn ' t excite me that much & i didn ' t really find any character to root for or like . the film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that i didn ' t really see the point of . < br / > < br / > director de palma directs with style & visual flair , from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it ' s impeccably filmed throughout . i ' d imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it . i felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though , nothing about it really excited me that much . there is a fair bit of nudity , some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence , kate ' s murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight , if that ' s the right word . however , it ' s by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe . < br / > < br / > with a supposed budget of about $ 6 , 500 , 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film . the new york locations are nice , the cinematography is good & as a whole it ' s extremely well made . i thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive . the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn ' t think caine had that much screen time . allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made , interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them , this & blow out ( 1981 ) , he cast her as a prostitute . . . a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start . < br / > < br / > dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn ' t think it quite lived up to it ' s lofty reputation . good but not brilliant . 
POS when people ask me why do i like movies so much , i usually respond , " have you seen the art - gallery sequence in de palma ' s dressed to kill ? " that scene alone , pretty much represents everything i want to see in a film . if i was a film director , that would be the kind of thing i ' d like to do . " pure cinema " is one way of describing that sequence , and it is truly amazing to see how director de palma ' s entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene . it is a dream - like movie , clever as hell , and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together . i think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion : could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success ? the film has no message to speak of , acting is great but it is at the service of the style , and the script is short on logic . de palma ' s movie makes a really good case that style , when handled properly , can sustain a feature length film . sure , michael caine , angie dickinson , nancy allen and keith gordon give superlative performances , but this is a director ' s movie all the way to the fadeout . it is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium . i won ' t tell you what hitchcock movie the film pays homage to ( i don ' t want to spoil any surprises ) , but i think de palma transcends the story ' s arc , and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career . not for the faint of heart ! 
POS from start to finish , i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie . it ' s amazing that " the groove tube " is possibly the granddaddy , yet raunchiest , of all comedic skit movies . this is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia ! for 73 minutes , the weird , strange humor never stops ! just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier ! it ' s way , way better than comedy central or any prime time show ! do yourself a favor and trash all those soft , lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket ! better yet , tell your box office manager you want " the groove tube " back on the big screen ! 
POS " the groove tube " was initially shown on video , in the first " video theaters " here in boston . in one room , there were tv monitors on high stands , with old movie theater seats , in small groups facing the monitors . there were old refrigerators stocked with pepsi , and baskets of york peppermint patties . in a second , smaller room , there were no seats , just large pillows . that was the ' smoking ' room , i . e . , people got high in there . that act only added to the hilarity of the video . < br / > < br / > i was a ' frequent viewer ' ; the scenes i liked most and remember to this day are : koko the clown , the kramp family kitchen ( kramp easy - lube shortening ) , safety sam / vd psa , the chevy chase hitchhiker w / nude runs through the woods , the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman . the last item was very reminiscent of the late , incredible ernie kovacs . now , i ' ve lost a lot of readers that are under 48 ( " who is ernie kovacs ? ? " ) but trust me , it ' s funny stuff . < br / > < br / > one reason i was a ' frequent viewer ' was that i , and my friends , would bring other " groove tube " virgins to see it . we would sit and slyly watch the faces of the ' virgins ' as the " safety sam " psa would play . as the camera slowly zooms in on " sam " , we would wait for that " oh ! " of recognition on the ' virgin ' s ' face . each time was more hilarious than the last . and then that ' virgin ' would then bring a friend to see the show , repeating what we had done . to get this joke , you must watch the video . < br / > < br / > yes , some of it is dated , but most plays , film , television , and now videos are . just look at any video made in the 1980 ' s . < br / > < br / > i did see " the groove tube " in a theater as a film , a grainy transfer from the original video . it had been cut , and was missing some of the original high - point scenes . < br / > < br / > the first " saturday night live " show , featuring chevy chase , elicited instant remarks of , " that ' s the guy from " the groove tube " " , so it was a precursor for chevy . < br / > < br / > i can ' t look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice - over , " coat your hands with a generous amount of kramp easy - lube shortening . . . " and thinking of the " kramp holiday loaf " recipe . always gets me laughing in the baking needs aisle in the grocery store . < br / > < br / > the early 70 ' s were parlous times ; " the groove tube " was fresh , new , and really ' got ' the humor of the times . it offered a ' hip generation ' , humor that wasn ' t available in any other format / medium . mjh 
POS i haven ' t watched the movie yet , but can ' t wait to see it ! it seems very interesting and inspirational . it was one of the most interesting trailers i ' ve ever seen : the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think , the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the " battle within " . . . thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing . this film looks so fresh and smart . and the actor is really hot . i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies , really clever . i thought that the topic selected - overcoming adversities and childhood traumas - is timeless , and god knows a lot of people need it . bring it on . 
POS this is a unique and bold film . it ' s energetic , with highly developed characters . very good performances . < br / > < br / > i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think . . . < br / > < br / > bret carr dares to look inward , ask questions , and dig underneath the surface . by the nature of the film , it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well . it can take some courage to do this . i can see how some close - minded people might find this quite disturbing . however , i found it thought - provoking , much more than just entertainment . < br / > < br / > bret carr is truly an original filmmaker , with vision . i am curious to see what he will do next . < br / > < br / > watch him . 
POS i watch movies for a living , picking out which ones are good enough to distribute . . . tossing aside those that don ' t make the cut . i ' m not saying that i know more than anyone else based on this , i ' m just leading you to how i came to watch " the gospel of lou " . . . anyways . . . so many bad movies land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them . i don ' t actually " watch " everything , usually i just look over at the tv occasionally while i ' m working the scan for production value , performance , and how well the story is being presented . if something catches my eye i ' ll take the time to watch it . " lou " drew me in during the first few minutes where i closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the tv so i could completely tune in . needless to say i was enthralled throughout the whole movie . the story is told well , the characters are either endearing or repulsive ( depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character ) and all very well played . at times i caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing , but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss . i ' ve heard other people ' s comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes , other time extreme elation . . . i was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie . sadly i was unable to acquire it because i was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short . that ' s the way it goes sometimes . . . but at least i had the pleasure of seeing this one and i can ' t wait to see what kind of response it gets . good luck and great fortune to you bret carr ( if you read this ) , you are without a doubt a talent to watch for . 
POS anyone who doesn ' t like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons . this film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times , but that is its intention . it asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like lou eventually does . it asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be . bret carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has . the intention and the message is clear and profound . people ' s apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities . an open - minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it . sometimes a life - changing realization does come in a flash - - a light bulb going on . this story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way . 
POS the men can slaver over lollo , if they like ( or her lollos - - she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french ) , but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe , who is not only beautiful but can act . don ' t be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple , dashing story of love and war , in which all is fair , they are not needed . all you need know is that , at the beginning of the film , lollobrigida reads philipe ' s palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king . thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running , jumping , and swordplay . < br / > < br / > on the minus side , the obviousness of the story and the heavy - handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying , and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts . and of course the non - french - speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh - la - la , such as : virtuous girl : i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan . seducer : my dear , what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle ? 
POS . . . and if you ' re very , very good it will resemble moon over parador . < br / > < br / > this film had a slightly silly story , but it was a fantasy after all , and the casting and the acting was spot - on ! dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / impostor , full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have . you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes . < br / > < br / > this was one of dreyfuss ' s best roles , just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator ! and the parting scene : like something out of casablanca , indeed ! < br / > < br / > raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police . he gets some really funny lines , some of which are homages to other films , like " round up the usual suspects ! " < br / > < br / > and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend - - in addition to being a really hot number : " you should get an oscar for tonight ! " < br / > < br / > let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves : sammy davis jr . , ike pappas , dick cavett - - all perfectly done . < br / > < br / > all in all , a memorable romp under the paradorian moon . < br / > < br / > - r . 
POS buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome . of course , we can go back to howard hawks ' s red river ( 1948 ) or further still to john ford ' s my darling clementine ( 1946 ) , but if we want to stick with this single decade , then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era ' s initial year . one is " the gunfighter , " an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger ( ringo ) facing his last shootout . another from that same year is " winchester ' 73 , " and it ' s worth noting that millard mitchell appears in both as grim , mustached , highly realistic range riders . in the gunfighter , he ' s the town marshal expected to arrest ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang . in winchester , he ' s the sidekick to jimmy stewart , a kind of horatio to stewart ' s hamlet in this epic / tragic tale . the plot is simple enough : stewart ' s lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match , beating the meanest man in the west ( stephen mcnally ) , who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father . when the brother steals the gun , stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier , meeting up with both outlaws and indians . ( in one wonderful bit , two future stars - rock hudson and tony curtis - play an indian chief and a u . s . cavalry soldier - during a well staged pitched - battle . dan duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader , while shelly winters , just before she began to gain weight , is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together . today , filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen , but anthony mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time , with not a minute wasted . such western legends as bat masterson and wyatt earp ( terrifically played by will geer ) make brief appearances , adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature . the final battle between good and bad brothers , high atop a series of jutting rock canyons , is now legendary among western buffs . it ' s also worth noting that stewart , however much associated he became with western films , does what is actually his first western leading man role here - yes , he was in destry rides again eleven years earlier , but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns ! 
POS in the fifties the age restrictions for films in brazil were the following : no restriction , 10 years old , 14 years old and 18 years old . usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old , when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14 , but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18 . winchester 73 was one of those , and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average . the hero , james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father . he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized , far from the average good guy . anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart . shelley winters , the leading lady was far from virtuous , she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle . dan duryea as waco johnnie dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered . the story of the film , which always follows the man who stays with the rifle , is one of the best suited for a western . it was to be made into a fritz lang film , which did not come through . when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang . with winchester , mann created a different conception of western , but still maintaining all its traditions . winchester still is a great film to see again and again , but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released . 
POS for anthony mann the western was ' legend ' - and ' legend ' makes the very best cinema ! mann ' s work was full of intensities and passions , visually dramatic , and the action always excitingly photographed . . . < br / > < br / > stewart , a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger , neurosis and cruelty , made with anthony mann , five remarkable westerns : " winchester ' 73 ; " " bend of the river ; " " the naked spur ; " " the far country ; " and " the man from laramie . " < br / > < br / > in " winchester ' 73 , " stewart reveals his darker side . . . he offers all the reserves of anger , inner ambivalence , and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had , up till this time , failed to catch . . . < br / > < br / > a carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style : shelley winters is at her saucy best ; dan duryea perfect as the vicious , sneering psychopathic villain ; john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character ; charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor ; and a very young rock hudson , attempts the role of an indian chief . . . < br / > < br / > " winchester ' 73 " is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized , rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876 . . . stewart and his estranged brother , who bears another name ( stephen mcnally ) , compete fiercely for possession of it , and though stewart wins , mcnally steals it and sets off cross - country with stewart in pursuit . . . what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic , is stewart ' s determination to revenge his father ' s death at the hands of that same renegade brother  a revenge fed by long - standing fratricidal hatred . . . < br / > < br / > photographed in gorgeous black & white , the film comes on as powerful and arresting , acted with deep feeling and intense concentration , not only by stewart but by all the supporting characters . . . < br / > < br / > look fast for a promising newcomer , tony curtis , the soldier who finds the rifle after the indian attack . . . 
POS i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review ! i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica ( being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe ) so i didn ' t know what to expect . . . but i did come out with a smile though i must admit . . . < br / > < br / > the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters . . . i won ' t give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this . < br / > < br / > must say . . . esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama . . . ( father of the admiral in battlestar galactica ) i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg . . . < br / > < br / > also eric stoltz fits his role precisely . . . ! special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome ! don ' t sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it . . without having to have see bsg ! . < br / > < br / > this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci - fi kick ! 
POS i wouldn ' t say this is a bad movie ; in fact it ' s pretty typical of the type of film that the " poverty row " studios were releasing at the time . filmed for monogram , bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor - scientist , masquerading as a respected member of the community . in this movie , bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides , and , after their demise , injecting bela ' s wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young . lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film , however , the movie suffers from the ultra - wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin . coffin ( nice name for a guy in a horror flick ) is especially bad in this case . i ' ve seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same ; stiff , wooden and utterly unconvincing . miss walters is only slightly better , but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable . still , the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end ! despite the poor acting by some , " the corpse vanishes " is an enjoyable movie for all to see . 
POS one thing is for sure . . . you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day . the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle . the story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on . eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense . all the characters were ok and wil smith did another good day at the office . < br / > < br / > there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do . whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant . the journey it takes you on is interesting enough , if not overwhelming . < br / > < br / > a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end . i would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights . 
POS will smith is one of the best actors of all time . i don ' t know how he does it . i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it . he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there . this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet . i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head . amazing and sad all at the same time . thanks again will . you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie . you cannot miss a thing . make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle . well worth the money that you will pay to watch it . . don ' t wait for it to come on tv . 
POS haunted by a secret , ben thomas ( will smith ) looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn ' t know . once his plan is set , nothing will be able to stop him . at least that ' s what he thinks . but ben hadn ' t planned on falling in love with one of these people and she ' s the one who will end up transforming him . will smith is back again with director gabriele muccino , after the life inspiring movie " the pursuit of happiness " . " seven pounds " is yet another life changing movie experience , which not only does reminds you of their previous collaboration , tearful , but inspires you joyfully in the end . will smith , also is the producer again with some of the others . these movies are very realistic , which depicts a common man ' s life & his struggles through life . seven pounds might have took some time to gain it ' s actual momentum , but just after half an hour of the movie , the movie is all set to rule your heart . also , this movie has some twists revolving around , which lets the viewers keep guessing . director gabriele muccino once again is the winner all the way , with his emotional yet inspiring message . he makes all the characters of the movie very real , that the people would actually find themselves in somewhere of the movie . along with the director , will smith is yet another winner , with his superb acting skills . once again , the duo of the director & the actor works as a charm . also , there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well . rosario dawson , beauty with brains , that ' s what she can be called . she looks beautiful & does her part extremely well . barry pepper , gives a great support to the movie & woody harrelson does the same , although woody did not had much screen timing ( would have been good if he had more ) . you won ' t forget this movie easily . watch this movie & change your life . top class cinema ! 
POS you spend most of this two - hour film wondering " what ' s the story regarding the lead character ? " < br / > < br / > will smith , as a low - key " ben thomas " will keep you guessing . the last 20 - 25 minutes is when you find out , and it ' s a shocker . . . . but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed . until then , smith , plays it mysterious , almost stalking people . you know he has a good reason for doing it , but it ' s never really explained , once again , to keep us guessing until the end . < br / > < br / > all of it , including a on again / off again but touching romance with rosario dawkins ( " emily posa " ) might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film . . . . . but don ' t because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together . < br / > < br / > this is a two - hour film and not the typical action - packed macho will smith film . in fact , the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn , sad face of smith throughout this story . it almost doesn ' t even look like him in a number of shots . he looks like he ' s lost weight and is sick . smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness . < br / > < br / > like a good movie will often do , this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits . 
POS my school ' s drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002 , and i can only hope we ' re as good as this ! i watched this film recently as sort of " research " for my role ( rosie alvarez ) , and i ' d just like to say , vanessa williams is the coolest ! < br / > < br / > wow ! the casting for this movie was right - on ( with one exception ) . jason alexander , oh my gawd , is there anything he can ' t do ? he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever - i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during " put on a happy face ! " he is so great ! vanessa williams , as i said before , is the coolest . she was a beautiful rosie , and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable . tyne daly was hilarious as albert ' s obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr . mcafee ( however i loved paul lynde ' s performance in the 1963 version ! ) . brigitta dau cracked me up as ursula merkle ; she really hammed it up ! and marc kudisch was an awesome conrad birdie . . . " suffer ! " < br / > < br / > there was only one casting that i didn ' t understand , and , as you ' ll see from previous comments , many other people didn ' t understand . chynna phillips as kim mcafee - what was that ? i mean she ' s really pretty and very talented , but . . . she looks a bit too old for the role . eh , maybe i ' m delusional . < br / > < br / > okay well anyways , i highly recommend this movie . it ' ll leave you smiling ! < br / > < br / > 
POS the plot of this film might not be extraordinary , but what makes the film really special , are its characters ( and the actors who play them  of course ! ) . i won ' t go into the details of the plot of the movie , but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone ! the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire . if you ' re not alert even for a second , you ' ll probably end up missing one of the subtle points . the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff - like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan , the advertisements on the tankers ( which i almost missed ) and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout . < br / > < br / > coming to the actors , john cusack has played his multi - faceted role very efficiently ( what with him being the co - writer and the producer too ) and he plays his character  hauser , the killer with a heart  exquisitely . cusack ' s done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank , but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb . < br / > < br / > however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff ! i have always been a huge fan of ms . duff . but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she ' s playing in the movie . but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor . let ' s face it ! the kid ' s growing , but yes , so is her talent ! all those critics , who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act , will be silent for a while . hilary had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside , yet a sweet child on the inside  and she ' s done complete justice to it . she makes you laugh , and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short ( ' cause i could go on raving about her for ever ) she ' s brilliant ! marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too . especially , joan ' s hysterics are uproarious ! however , i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster . < br / > < br / > in general war , inc . keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor , and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot . i would highly recommend this movie to all ( and more so to hilary duff fans ) ! ! ! p . s . - i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon ! ! ! 
POS in this satire of the commercialization and ' lightheartedness ' of war , john cusack plays brand hauser , an assassin sent to to ' turaqistan ' to take out omar sharif , who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the us ' s own company . in addition to this , hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer , a wedding for pop princess yonica ( hillary duff ) , and a nosy liberal journalist , natalie ( marisa tomei ) . < br / > < br / > assessing the technical aspects : < br / > < br / > - the acting ( by the main characters , at least ) was good , as was to be expected . some of john cusack ' s dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it . . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate . joan put forth a great , and often hilarious , performance . marisa tomei , while i ' ve never been a big fan of hers , was more than suitable for the role and worked well . hillary duff , however , was pretty terrible . they needed an attractive middle eastern ( or russian , or whatever that accent was supposed to be ) pop - star . unfortunately , they went 0 for 3 with her . < br / > < br / > - like i said above , the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points , especially john cusack ' s dialogue . not much of it , mind , but some . the story also got a bit ludicrous at points , which is fine for a satire to a point , but it took it to a whole new level here . luckily , the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool , calm demeanor throughout , and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors . < br / > < br / > - joshua seftel , who previously had a drought of real credits to his name , did a fine job with a rather wide - spectrum film . he handled the small ( $ 10 million ) budget very well , stretching it to make it appear to be much more . seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story . . . with the painful and hard - to - watch parts of the real war ( including slaughter of civilians , etc . ) . < br / > < br / > - as far as the general satire goes , its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done , especially the ' golden palace poker ' ads on the u . s . tanks . at points , it becomes a little too much , but , in the end , it still accurate portrays what it ' s going for an a young ' mel brooks ' - type of style . < br / > < br / > overall , the film is very well made for the meager budget and it ' s definitely worthy of a look . it won ' t go down as one of the great satires of cinema , but it ' s certainly not the worst . < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 . 
POS cute film about three lively sisters from switzerland ( often seen running about in matching outfits ) who want to get their parents back together ( seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad ) - so they sail off to new york to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold - digger he calls " precious " . dad hasn ' t seen his daughters in ten years , they ( oddly enough ) don ' t seem to mind and think he ' s wonderful , and meanwhile precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother ( alice brady ) , a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man . the sisters get the idea of pushing precious into the path of a drunken hungarian count , tricking the two gold - digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in europe . but a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good - looking ray milland , who goes along with the scheme ' cause he has a crush on sister kay . < br / > < br / > this film is enjoyable , light fare . barbara read as kay comes across as sweet and pretty , ray milland looks oh so young and handsome here ( though , unfortunately , is given little to do ) , alice brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is deanna durbin , a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister penny , who pretty much steals the show . with absolutely beautiful vocals , she sings several songs throughout the film , though i actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this . the plot in this film is a bit silly , but nevertheless , i found the film to be entertaining and fun . 
POS time paradoxes are the devil ' s snare for underemployed minds . they ' re fun to consider in a ' what if ? ' sort of way . film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including ' star trek : first contact ' , the ' back to the future ' trilogy , ' bill and ted ' s excellent adventure ' , ' groundhog day ' and the stargate sg1 homage , ' window of opportunity ' . heinlein ' s ' all you zombies ' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time . < br / > < br / > in the case of terry gilliam ' s excellent film , ' 12 monkeys ' , it ' s hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re - think our conception of the film . repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind . < br / > < br / > some , seeing the film for the first time , will regard cole , played by bruce willis , as a schizophrenic . most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as ' the continual wrenching of experience ' visited upon him by time travel . < br / > < br / > unlike other time travel stories , ' 12 monkeys ' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past . cole tells his psychiatrist , railly ( madeleine stowe ) , that time cannot be changed , but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 , in his own personal time - line . < br / > < br / > even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time - line universe , in order to ensure that the time - line is not altered . . . cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized . if that ' s the case , time is like a fluid , it always finds its own level or path , irrespective of the external forces working on it . it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much . < br / > < br / > if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time , as we see on board the plane at the end of the film , then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events . . . or does it ? the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians 
POS first of all , we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you ' ll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same . his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far . . . and counting . the story begins in the ( not so far ) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth . the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story . about that . movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you ' ll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down . its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good . but that doesn ' t mean that the ending wont pull your nerves , cause its pretty good . as far as the direction goes , it is prefect . movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better . so , if you are getting ready to see a sci - fi movie or some action , you ' ll miss it . b there should be more movies like this . 
POS i can ' t decide whether this is one of my favourite movies . it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can ' t decide . i definitely liked it . this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen . my first impression ? i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex ( to be confusing ) . < br / > < br / > the movie is set in the future . a man james cole ( bruce willis ) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past ( 1996 to be specific ) . a virus killed 5 billion people . he is sent from the future to get some information about it . also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn railly . the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life . the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end . < br / > < br / > one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post - apocalyptic movies , the movie didn ' t prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life . " you want to see the ocean , be with her " is especially a poignant line in this movie . it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person ' s mind . therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on . this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990 ' s . the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters . < br / > < br / > the performances are quite good . bruce willis surprised me here as he didn ' t act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love . his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully . i have to check out his other movies . the gorgeous madeleine stowe is quite a treat to watch . ever since i saw this movie , i have become so obsessed with her . she has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him . brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey goines . his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn ' t have many critics who have kind words for him . < br / > < br / > the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie . the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested . and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary . < br / > < br / > good thriller 10 / 10 
POS i saw his movie in dallas , texas when it came out in 1986 . i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie . after seeing the movie i can see why . the movie was not bad , nor was it great . the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story . they created a new story , new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga . my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth . they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue . as a kid , i loved the movie . but unfortunately i haven ' t seen it as an adult and can ' t give a better review . looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re - evaluate my stance on it . that being said , will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge ? i love robotech and can ' t wait for the shadows chronicles . 
POS my father , dr . gordon warner ( ret . major , us marine corps ) , was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese , and also received the navy cross . i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then , as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real - life . my father is a fanatic of facts and figures , and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that . < br / > < br / > he currently lives in okinawa , japan , married to my mother for over 40 years ( ironically , she ' s japanese ) , and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii . < br / > < br / > my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine , you ' re always a marine . and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much . < br / > < br / > i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it . and i ' d love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year ! 
POS even if you ' re not a big ramones fan , rock ' n ' roll high school is * still * the greatest rock ' n ' roll movie ever made . why ? because under all the campiness , it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel ( and justifiably so ) for the boring , stupid , fascist , establishment world of adults . that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen . " mine eyes have seen the glory of the . . . " rock ' n ' roll ! < br / > < br / > 
POS loved the movie . loved the two families crossing paths in history . only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family ' s line continue ? he is madame zeroni ' s son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children ? hmmmmmmmmm . never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher ? maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit ? even with the mistakes in the movie . just loved it . the acting was great . not sure where the story was with mr . sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier . the other " counseler " did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much . poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up . 
POS i was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary , and i waited a good while for this to come through the pipes ( my local video chain ) , and it was worth the wait . i like a good documentary / special interest piece , but this was definitely a heartfelt , honest , and nostalgic , if you will , look back on adolescent life . the imagination of a child is fascinating , and that ' s where a great story begins . rent it or buy it if you like a good , humorous , and all around entertaining documentary . mr . stein and company have definitely come a long way from neighborhood video camcorder productions of bank hold - ups , and gay - rings that turn people gay from one glance . they all seem rather successful in they ' re respectful fields , and it was good to know that they are all still good friends . the dvd has a few extra trailers for other good documentaries , and it features a number of darren ' s most notable productions , including , crazy news . 
POS god ! zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan , and probably had about as many actors in the title role . < br / > < br / > this serial is one of my own personal favourites , and as previously stated , it is one of the top 5 sound serials . oddly enough , this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 . * by the time of this production in ' 39 , zorro was really well known as a ( pulp ) literary and movie character . the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the mexico ' s struggle for freedom from rule by a european monarchy , namely spain . the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary war . < br / > < br / > the story concentrates its attention to the mythical province of san mendelito and its ' council ' . it is being addressed by benito juarez * * on their gold mine ' s relation to the new republic of mexico . gold shipments must get thru to mexico city . < br / > < br / > don francisco uncle to diego vega , states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys . a thug from the don del oro mob , stages an ' insult ' to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords , don frasncisco getting run through . < br / > < br / > suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark ' z ' on the face of the bad guy , he dispatches him to the hereafter . don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward ramon ( william corson ) that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles . he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del oro , but expires before completing statement . < br / > < br / > there is a big reception for diego at don francisco ' s hacienda , where diego disappoints ramon ' sister ( also ward of don francisco ) with his timid act . " a fop ! ! " , she declares . < br / > < br / > later , diego and ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers . when they ask , " who will lead us with don francisco now dead ? " , ramon declares " zorro , we are zorro ' s fighting legion ! " well there is a big battle with the legion , now all clad on gray , with masks and capes , protecting the gold train . then zorro seems trapped at a man - made avalanche intended for the convoy , when , well , you know cliffhanger end of chapter one . < br / > < br / > wow ! that was a lot of writing for one chapter , but like most other serials , the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line . let ' s just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good , well made , action filled chapters following . < br / > < br / > zorro ' s fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action . we have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups . there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of ' don del oro ' . we had soldiers , renegade whites , hostile indians and the legion . < br / > < br / > in short , it ' s safe to say that there is everything one could want , and then some , in this serial . and , incidentally , they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accents . < br / > < br / > as to just what is there here that makes zfl stand out from the rest ? what makes it different or unique ? well . . . . . . . . < br / > < br / > first of all , it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen . the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one . this is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track . < br / > < br / > and yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others . that is , the film not only has a heroic musical theme , but it also sports lyrics , yes , the legionairres sing ! we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters ! it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing . < br / > < br / > when the serial was first shown on our local television ( circa 1955 ) , all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as belonging to ' captain braddock from racket squad , the tv series . mr . hadley had a very distinctive , deep voice . * * * he also handled the role very well . his costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional . < br / > < br / > there is a small slip up . a sort of minor anachronism occurs by having benito juarez ( carleton young ) addressing the san mendelito council , as juarez was about 18 years old at this time ( 1824 ) and , though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in mexico ' s history , he surely hadn ' t achieved such prominence yet . his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner brothers ' juarez that year , which starred paul muni in the title role . < br / > < br / > this is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial , but also my favourite zorro film . < br / > < br / > * we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year , what with gone with the wind , mr . smith goes to washington , the citadel , juarez , the wizard of oz , of mice and men , one million b . c . , zenobia , we want our mummy all counted among the output that year . < br / > < br / > * * once again , juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 , about 25 years later . also , the political sub - divisions are referred to as ' provinces ' in the story . in actuality , they are called ' states ' . just as we are called the united states of america , so too , south of the border they call their repubhlic the united states of mexico . < br / > < br / > * * * reed hadley was prominent in some very ' a ' pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect . watch & listen for his narration in the house on 92nd street ( 1945 ) and guadalcanal diary ( 1945 ) . 
POS i rank this the best of the zorro chapterplays . the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play . there is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter . reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro . last , but certainly not least , is the great directing team of whitney and english . 
POS i ' ve bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasn ' t an option . a certain company i won ' t identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds ( " clean and sober " , " star 80 " , and this one , to name just three ! ) of films i don ' t think anyone wants to see in this compromised format . some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 1 . 66 : 1 ratio . < br / > < br / > that off my chest , i ' ll say " deathtrap " was a spooky and oddly enough , amusing picture . my only complaints are the tinny score ( what is that f____g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france ? ) and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals . couldn ' t her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed ? minor complaints , both . the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you don ' t like . < br / > < br / > i never saw a staged version of " deathtrap " , so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time . before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg , the theatre was more affordable to average people . now , anyone paying less than a king ' s ransom to get live entertainment probably isn ' t going to a hit show on the great hyped way . < br / > < br / > michael caine and christopher reeve were both large , virile specimens in the early 80s and that ' s integral to how we ' ll react to their profession and overall image here . they ' re definitely not bookish men who can ' t fight or will back down from an obstacle . the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate " deathtrap " . 
POS the comparison to sleuth , the earlier stage - play - turned - film , is obvious and upon my first viewing i too thought sleuth was better , but deathtrap has , at least for me , many more repeat viewings in it than sleuth . < br / > < br / > i purchased deathrap in the bargain bin at wal - mart , figuring that it had caine and the underrated reeve and was worth the 6 bucks . it was one of the finest dvd purchases i could ' ve picked up . < br / > < br / > it ' s one of those best - kept - secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover . and it ' s totally worth repeat viewings . < br / > < br / > though laurence olivier and michael caine turned in bravado performances in sleuth , i was doubly impressed with christopher reeve as clifford anderson . reeve , rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of superman , stole the show in what should ' ve been an oscar worthy performance . i ' ve always felt reeve was a type - cast actor who didn ' t get much of a chance to shine outside of the superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like somewhere in time , but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use , thank goodness . < br / > < br / > i absolutely relished michael caine ' s performance . he was glib , deliciously manipulative and sadistic . and watching him work with reeve and dyan cannon was an absolute pleasure . in fact , it was thanks to this movie that i got into a " michael caine phase " and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible . < br / > < br / > as for deathtrap , there ' s enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its " memorable quotes " section . ( unfortunately , much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot ) . < br / > < br / > it ' s really , really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own . needless to say , it ' s a must - see . but for me , it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time . < br / > < br / > repeat viewings are a must . < br / > < br / > and it deserves to sit alongside sleuth on your dvd shelf . < br / > < br / > i ' ll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film : " i wonder if it wouldn ' t be . . . well . . . just a trifle starry - eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration . . . where i could count on no sense of moral obligation . . . whatsoever . " 
POS one of b - and c - movie producer roger corman ' s greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle ( originally designated for cheap trick ) , rock n ' roll high school . it ' s just a simple , technically dated story ( but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funny - - see eaglebauer ' s van ) about teenagers who love rock n ' roll . < br / > < br / > students at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal , miss evelyn togar ( played by cult classic favorite , mary woronov ) who fears that rock n ' roll turns kids into uncontrollable , amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n ' roll - free zone . actually , she intends to wipe out rock n ' roll for all students , regardless of whether its at school , and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful . < br / > < br / > but not if riff randell ( pj soles ) can help it . a ramones fanatic , she has written some songs ( including rock n ' roll high school ) that she wants to give to the ramones , and in trying to do so , is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town . it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun - hating adults and the teenagers ( in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge , somewhat ) . after the years of punk , when the fame of garage rockers , the ramones ( and others ) would mark another shift in music evolution , it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous , exaggerated way . < br / > < br / > it is mostly mild comedy , but a great feel - good comedy nonetheless when you ' re in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you . with jerry zucker ( of airplane fame ) and joe dante ( of gremlins fame ) both taking part in some of the directing , you can get the idea for what kind of humor you ' re in for ( and not to mention , expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the film ' s finale ) . the story must ' ve later inspired ( and was consequently updated ) by the mid - 90s comedy , detroit rock city , which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers , kizz . < br / > < br / > i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle , rock n ' roll high school forever , released nearly a decade later . the original is still the best . 
POS very heart warming and uplifting movie . outstanding performance by alisan porter ( curly sue ) . i saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely . i just caught it again on the mplex channel , and curly sue touched my heart again . 
POS i have to agree with cal - 37 it ' s a great movie , specially for the family , kelly linch is beautiful , the little girl is really talented and cute , of course jim belushi has earned his strips ! but want i really liked was the piano song , if you ' re a musician or not watch this movie just for that , you ' ll know which it is . < br / > < br / > " you ' re nobody till somebody loves you " written by russ morgan , larry stock , and james cavanaugh < br / > < br / > so have fun watching < br / > < br / > see ya , < br / > < br / > nelson 
POS curly sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter . she and her father , bill ( jim belushi ) , try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists . in chicago , bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim . it happens to be a very upscale lawyer named grey ( kelly lynch ) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done . not only do the scammers make some cash , they get to spend the night at grey ' s plush apartment . even then , grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell . grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life . who better to teach her than bill and curly , those savvy experts on life ' s realities ? but , all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men . or is there ? this is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected . curly is certainly as entertaining as shirley temple but much edgier , of course . belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer . john hughes , as writer and director , shows us his magic touch once again , as the script is lively and unpredictable . just watch curly and bill take grey out for a night , with no money , and see the humorous results . do you long for happy endings , long promised and finally delivered , with a few uncertain moments in between ? this is your made - to - order movie . 
POS when i was young i had seen very few movies . my parents in all their wisdom rented this one . i was very wary of what the movie was about , in fact i wasn ' t even allowed to watch it . my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry . so what did i do ? late at night i trashed the vcr ! kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals . i was arrested of course , i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived . i was only given a stern talking to and sent home . my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr . this tore me apart , slave labour really sucks believe me , but i had to do it . chores all around the house . what happened in the end ? we got a big screen tv , dvd player and a surround sound system for my work . how did i get the money ? easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney ! do you remember finding neno ? well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks ! they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn ' t afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done ! in the end i never saw the film the head that didn ' t die and the rating i gave it is my life rating ! it ' s doing pretty good ! 
POS when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it . that ' s not the case with this one . a great story about a young girl who ' s had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right . < br / > < br / > eric etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong . < br / > < br / > both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film , but eric ' s performance is definitely the show stealer in this story . < br / > < br / > i definitely recommend this film for it ' s complexity , performance , and great over all story . 
POS it was " the night he came home , " warned the posters for john carpenter ' s career - making horror classic . set in a small american town , halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers ' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode , and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways . . . leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael . this plot out - line inspired countless horror knock - offs throughout the 80s , 90s and continues to do so today , as well as a poorly received 2007 remake . the difference between them , and this , is , quite simply , that " halloween " is the best . < br / > < br / > made on a very modest , tight budget . . . halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub - genre of " sexually promiscuous - teens getting stalked by a knife / axe / chainsaw / wielding psycho " . 
POS as i mentioned previously , john carpenter ' s 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by ( the other being the classic conan the barbarian ) . it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers , whom i eventually befriended ( imaginary friend ) to keep him from killing me in my sleep . now that is terror for a 10 year old . < br / > < br / > it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves . the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works , perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious . this all could happen . it isn ' t in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country ( as most modern horror is , i . e . hostel , touristas , cry wolf , saw , etc ) . at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations . i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head . it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create . so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety . < br / > < br / > carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday , middle class , suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister . he then spends the next 15 years in an institution ( which we thankfully do not experience ) only to escape and return to his hometown , the infamous haddonfield . on his way he kills and kills . the child ' s name is michael meyers , though he is not a person . john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia . in the bastion of american safety and security , chaos can still strike . < br / > < br / > michael ceased to be a person once he killed . he is not a serial killer , human being or psychopath . he is as unstoppable force . the generic overalls , bleached - white shatner mask , and lack of any dialog other then some breathing , helps to dehumanize and complete michael ' s generification . this is the source of all his power . he is faceless , speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos . this is helped by the cinematography ( post card effect ) , a lack of information / motivation / explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence ( dr . loomis ) . his over the top performance and uneasiness sells " the shape " . this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode , the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds ( at least for a little bit ) . < br / > < br / > though this isn ' t the first movie of this new niche of horror films ( black christmas came out 4 years earlier ) , it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing . if you haven ' t been scared by horror movies in a long time ( like me ) , this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack . i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter ' s career . 
POS the first time i saw this movie , i fell in love with it . the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost . i expected a gore fest , but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack ( it ' s actually my ringer at the moment : p ) . the fact that i couldn ' t predict when he ' d kill and when he ' d disappear was a major plus in my book . predictable horror movies bore me . now , i know the storyline had some discrepancies , but , if you ' re like me , you don ' t even notice them until long after the movie ' s over and you ' re laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion . finally , as i mentioned , the soundtrack is timeless . it ' s one of my all time favorite theatrical scores , so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake . speaking of the remake , i read a very comprehensive article on it and , now that i know that mr . zombie reveres john carpenter , i have high hopes for his take on this classic . this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling , but it ' s the perfect addition , opener , finale , you name it for an all hallow ' s eve movie marathon . : ) 
POS john carpenter ' s halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece . it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers , who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters . < br / > < br / > this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise . carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters ; unusual for a horror picture . < br / > < br / > even more unusual is the non - existence of blood and gore , and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date . get that ! < br / > < br / > halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance ' s career . a true classic . 
POS why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime . " conan " is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better . the brutal violence , cool character designs , and good pacing , make this one of the best fantasies around . it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen . this is not similar to bakshi ' s usual frenetic style . it ' s quite a departure for bakshi , and in my opinion his best work . i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves . 
POS camp with a capital c . think of mask and the ace ventura movies - - then multiply by 100 . this laugh - a - minute entertainer takes schlock to the level of high art . david dhawan is a genius and govinda is beyond description . see it over and over again . i insist . 
POS well i was a teenager when i saw the movie . . the songs were a huge hit but the elite class skipped govinda movies back then coz watching govinda and karishma ( aka karizma ) movies were not the in thing for that ' class ' but anyways a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies rocked the 90 ' s through out and most of them were successful . . today i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered , there was a long que of people and the riot they created when the a aa e uo uo o song came on screen . . . . the dresses of govinda and karishma were complimentary to each other ( the worst dressing duo of that time ) well karisma in the late 90 ' s transformed but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer as his dress sense remains the same . . . but back then it all blended it was all good . . everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it was missing and then . . . . . there was no looking back for this jodi as it went on n on making those indian carry on series . . hated by a few but loved by the masses . < br / > < br / > if you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on tv i don ' t think you will regret it . . . but remember its the worst at its best . . < br / > < br / > still i watch those movies when i get time coz i cant stop laughing . . . so i say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when its done by the kings of their times it surely is watchable . . . i recommend it to all movie lovers . . . 
POS where would one start a review of the film snitch ' d ? james cahill , god rest his soul , made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man . his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure , which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor ! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking , and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1 , and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner , but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear . < br / > < br / > cahill ' s grasp of effects , both visual and aural is electrifying , the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch ' d , a real gritty like underground thriller . also , kudos to his brilliant use of makeup , such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue ! yuck ! i feel the world of film is much less from james ' passing , his memory will linger on and on and on , reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production , snitch ' d . his insightful director ' s commentary released a coke - hit up the nose of any discerning film goer , truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets , captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl . < br / > < br / > but i ask you , why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap ? i ' ll tell you why , because thats life in santa ana baby , its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle ' s offices , oh no . there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft , tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children ' s production of double dragon : the play . < br / > < br / > the only qualm i have with this film , is that there was never a sequel made . come on steven spielberg , come on george lucas , come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23 , how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man , james cahill . < br / > < br / > he discovered eva longoria you know . oh yeah , that he did . < br / > < br / > jonah 
POS i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had . only £ 300 , 000 and 7 weeks to write , film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself . although this film is not for the masses ( as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo - eroticism involved in the story ) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story , the more sadness you feel . more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned . < br / > < br / > this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again . i think that it ' s a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all . 
POS whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year . she is hilarious . of course there was a major serious side to the show . she was great not only because she ' s funny , but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum . white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards ' ceremonies , employment , and representation are way out of balance racially . there should be no need for " black " awards shows . the white - bread , milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to " white " directors , producers , actors , etc . allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste . he had no business being there . the fact of the matter is , this is the first oscar presentation i ' ve watched since " the color purple " was up for awards . that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002 . which is not to denigrate other presenters . billy crystal is a riot . 
POS this film is moving without being sentimental - meaningful without being pretentious . it tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as the encroachments of technology and an advancing society make the family - run business increasingly untenable . < br / > < br / > the acting is wonderful - though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors , we should have long ago - they play their characters with honesty and reverence - these are flawed characters , each with major weaknesses , but with such utter humanity and kindness that it ' s impossible not to become engaged in the story . < br / > < br / > we need more films like this - we need more western filmmakers creating films such as this . 
POS although kris kristofferson is good in this role , who wouldn ' t want to see elvis pressly instead ? with the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away elvis ' agent to be apart of the movie , it was a mistake . this would have been a perfect movie for elvis . even though the soundtrack is far from terrific , paul williams and barbra streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this " period " piece / musical . somewhat of a love story , this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption . like is most tragedies , the hero of the story was die . also , gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role . 
POS i saw this movie in the theater when it came out . i grew up in scottsdale and i went to arizona state and really enjoyed seeing locations where i spent so much time . i remember at the time thinking that barbara ' s venture into more of a rock sound ( actually r and b - to my ears ) was a successful one . i was never a fan of kris ' s singing until his last effort for new west . as a songwriter and an actor , though , he has serious chops , imho . i think it is a fine romance . i like it better than the judy garland version and never saw selznick ' s janet gaynor original . < br / > < br / > i do believe that they made some changes in this long - awaited dvd release . among other things , i recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed sun devil stadium being longer and more dramatic . i wish they had done a better job writing music for kris or god forbid , put some of his original songs in there . < br / > < br / > along those lines i have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for kris and barbara . while doing interviews for my own new music documentary , rocking the boat : a musical conversation and journey , i interviewed stephen bruton , a fine singer / songwriter / guitarist with close professional and personal ties to kris , bonnie raitt , and delbert mcclinton , among many others . stephen was in " speedway , " the john norman character ' s band . kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock . stephen was and is kris ' s friend and long time band member . there was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at kris in barbara ' s presence . she remarked to the effect that the band shouldn ' t talk to him like that . kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they were rock and roll ! in the end , barbara came around and decided to use kris ' s band ' s live performances in the movie and specifically sited stephen ' s role in making things work . i gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story . much is made of her as a diva . what she is is a pro . and i am not gay . not that there is anything wrong with that . 
POS considering ' a star is born ' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production , the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble . a viewer could be forgiven for believing that kris kristofferson & barbara streisand were a couple off screen as well as on , with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another . < br / > < br / > the film has been described in the past as a ' barbara streisand concert on film , set to a soap opera storyline ' however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive - a star is born is well worth the hiring price . < br / > < br / > with its incredible soundtrack , flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life ; a star is born is a film that draws you into the world of esther hoffman & the love of her life john norman howard . < br / > < br / > a film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love - the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart . . . 
POS thirty years after its initial release , the third version of " a star is born " finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand . that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers , the feminist anthem " woman in the moon " from this 1976 film . easy to dismiss , the movie ' s career - polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of hollywood - style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including streisand ' s own " funny girl " . this time reset to the then - contemporary music scene , the timeworn plot follows self - destructive rock star john norman howard on his deep - dive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big break . < br / > < br / > troubles dog their courtship from the outset , as john norman ( both names please ) responds to grasping fans and bloodless djs with random acts of violence ( from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution ) . to john norman , esther represents his last shot at happiness , and in turn , she is drawn to the innately decent , creative musician underneath the façade . in the movie ' s most pivotal scene , he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert , and her career takes off . inevitably , he can ' t handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success , and if you are familiar with any version of this story , you know the rest . directed by frank pierson ( although streisand ' s budding directorial talents are obviously on display ) , the film still manages to draw me in , even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative . it still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws . < br / > < br / > although streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star , her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play esther credibly . the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer adult contemporary - oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock . from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the oreos , she can ' t help but come across as an established star . i can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent , but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes esther more strident than poignant when john norman ' s woes become overwhelming . this creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than esther ' s response to it . this is capped off by an uninterrupted eight - minute close - up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics john norman ' s style toward the end . < br / > < br / > kristofferson , on the other hand , gives a superb performance throughout , managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love , pride and resentment toward esther . he makes his vodka - soaked onstage growling work within this context . otherwise , what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn ' t exist unless they were interacting with the two principals . the only ones who register are paul mazursky as john norman ' s level - headed manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager bobbie . veteran cameraman robert surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print . a big seller in its day , the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970 ' s - some songs still quite good ( " everything " , " woman in the moon " , " watch closely now " ) , some that have moved to kitsch ( " queen bee " , kenny loggins ' " i believe in love " ) and of course , the inescapable " evergreen " . < br / > < br / > the print transfer on the 2006 dvd is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering . streisand ' s participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature - length commentary . she gives insightful information about the genesis of the film , the casting and the reportedly troubled production . she is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of jon peters , her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie ' s producer , and her dissatisfaction with pierson as a director . i just wish she could have provided more scene - specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen . she also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her , e . g . , it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of peters . i think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her . < br / > < br / > there is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970 ' s clothes , especially kristofferson ' s mixed - fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt . there are also twelve deleted scenes included with streisand ' s optional commentary . one is a comic bread - baking scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in farcical comedies . another is an extended scene in which she plays " evergreen " on the guitar in front of an awestruck kristofferson who then falls asleep . the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts , which i agree with streisand should have been used . fittingly , the theatrical trailers for all three versions of " a star is born " are also included . 
POS the ancient mariner is a truly classic piece of work , as the original poem was / is . the context / setting with the old mariner himself is fine , clear , and without pretense . the artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time / period of the setting and of the work itself , carrying the audience into the period with a still , yet moving accompaniment , using excellent still - movement strategies only well conquered by the pre - mtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works . ( mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through , often irrelevant cuts , from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline . ) the voice , intonation and vitality of redgrave ' s reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear , strife and pain . in addition , the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone ( in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself ) of the author ' s rendition of the ancient mariner ' s sad and spooky tale . this is a must for any love of classic poetry , the sea , a tall tale , that almost rings true , and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture . who does not understand the meaning of an " albatross " ? or the concept of " water , water everywhere and not a drop to drink ? " a truly fine experience . thank you mr . dasilva for bringing this to life for us , never to be forgotten . 
POS personally , i disdain the jerry springer show , however , i found " ringmaster " to be the funniest movie i ' ve seen this year . the never - ending satire of jerry springer " guests " starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie . despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence , i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value . 
POS i can ' t agree with any of the comments . first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel , it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it ' s an all different matter . i couldn ' t believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly . the plot may be as bad as a js ' s show ( ie there is no plot ) but the acting is wicked , it ' s hilarious and it ' s all in all an incredible trash movie . < br / > < br / > it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society , and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america ( and i believe there are plenty of them ! ) are interested in . after all it ' s the neighbours we ' re talking about , don ' t we ? < br / > < br / > 100 % fun ! 
POS this show is awesome ! and i ' ve seen it about 6 times . < br / > < br / > granted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies , but i think it ' s great , very funny and excellently written ! 
POS " foxes " is a great film . the four young actresses jodie foster , cherie currie , marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are wonderful . the song " on the radio " by donna summer is lovely . a great film . * * * * * 
POS warning : does contain spoilers . < br / > < br / > open your eyes < br / > < br / > if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so , just stop reading here and take my word for it . you have to see this film . i have seen it four times so far and i still haven ' t made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film . that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film , then stop reading right now . < br / > < br / > if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think . < br / > < br / > i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well . his name was mr . krisak . to me , he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren ' t all too keen on . if we didn ' t like shakespeare , then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it . our class room was never a room , it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time . this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge - like minds . < br / > < br / > i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind , like the phone number of a long lost best friend , and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix . now if i didn ' t know better , i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr . krisak . but giving them the benefit of the doubt , we ' ll assume it wasn ' t him . but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable . < br / > < br / > he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real . show me how you can tell that you are real . this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that i ' m sure you can imagine . everything from pain , to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real . after every scenario that we gave him , he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless . < br / > < br / > " what if you are nothing but someone else ' s dream ? " < br / > < br / > what if you were someone else ' s dream ? what a messed up question that is . this was a question / scenario posed to us about 15 years ago , before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers . how possible could it seem back then ? but if you look at today ' s technology , now ask yourself , what it you were a part of someone else ' s dream . < br / > < br / > another brilliant but surreal film this year , david lynch ' s mulholland drive explored similar areas . but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to . in short this is one film that will literally ( if you let it ) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you . < br / > < br / > open your eyes . < br / > < br / > tom cruise plays david aames , a young , hot shot , righteous , full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines . he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy , his board of governers , the seven dwarfs , think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth . they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them . < br / > < br / > early in the film we meet one of david ' s gorgeous toys named julie gianni , played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz . david and julie play a good game , both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous , committed relationship . this is the type of relationship commensurate with david ' s other flings he ' s had in the sexual prime of his life . and although both talk a good game , we can tell that only one is really telling the truth . < br / > < br / > next we meet brian shelby , played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith ' s good buddy jason lee . brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends . this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film . brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again . and that is " the sweet ain ' t so sweet without the bitter . " he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two . < br / > < br / > at david ' s huge birthday bash , ( so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday ) brian enters with his date , sofia sorrano , played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress . this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another . and in typical david fashion , despite his best friend being there , he begins to flirt with sofia . to complicate things , julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david . david then spends the night with sofia , but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another . there is no hanky panky . the next day , as david is leaving sofia ' s apartment , he is greeted by julie , who offers him a ride and from there . . . . . . . well , i think we have all seen the commercials . < br / > < br / > that is all i will really say about the plot , because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception . we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze . there is a subtext of death and possible panacea - like cure - alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life . this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us , but it doesn ' t end there . < br / > < br / > like many movies seem to thrive on today , this film has a secret . sixth sense may have began this craze , but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze . regardless of how it originated , vanilla sky has one of it ' s own surreptitious gut busters . and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through . i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up , something more i can understand . to be able to work your mind in the theater , to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film . all of the ersatz so called " best pictures of the year " have been good but nothing spectacular . they lack substance . a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat , the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven . vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it . i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who don ' t like it don ' t quite understand it . < br / > < br / > this is what film making is supposed to be like . this is what a film is supposed to do to you . it is supposed to make you feel something . most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces . this one isn ' t . < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10 the best film of the year . i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress , diaz for best supporting , cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor . cameron crowe should there as well . none of this may come to pass , and that is a shame . this is one film that should not be missed . < br / > < br / > and on a final note , i am quite sure mr . krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question . can you prove you are real ? or are we just a figment of someone ' s imagination ? are we artificially transplanted for someone else ' s bemusement ? this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers . and i ' m sure that is just fine with him . < br / > < br / > open your eyes 
POS i could not agree more with the quote " this is one of the best films ever made . " if you think vanilla sky is simply a " re - make , " you could not be more wrong . there is tremendous depth in this film : visually , musically , and emotionally . < br / > < br / > visually , because the film is soft and delicate at times ( early scenes with sofia ) and at other times powerful and intense ( times square , post - climactic scenes ) . < br / > < br / > the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly . without the music , the story is only half told . nancy wilson created an emotional , yet eclectic , score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream - like theme ( although never released , i was able to get my hands on the original score for about $ 60 . if you look hard , you may be able to find a copy yourself ) . crowe ' s other musical selections , such as the beach boys , josh rouse , spiritualized , sigur ros , the monkees , etcetera etcetera , are also perfect fits for the film ( crowe has an ear for great music ) . < br / > < br / > more importantly , the emotional themes in this film ( i . e . love , sadness , regret ) are very powerful , and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience , as well as the ingenious dialogue ; i admit , the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again . < br / > < br / > the best part of this film however ( as if it could get any better ) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film , you will catch something new - - so watch closely , and be prepared to think ! sure , a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch , but there is always more to the story than you think . < br / > < br / > this is easily cameron crowe ' s best work , and altogether a work of brilliance . much of my film - making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone . it has honestly touched my life , as true art has a tendency of doing . it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is ( i guess to understand true art is an art itself ) . < br / > < br / > bottom line : vanilla sky is in a league of its own . 
POS years ago , i found a " bargain bin " copy of this film for a buck or two . in so many ways , this is quite fitting , as when it was made back in 1933 , it was truly a cheaply made film by the " poverty row " studio , majestic . however , while the film is rather derivative , it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises . < br / > < br / > the story is very , very familiar , as in some germanic town , the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires ! adding to this familiarity is dwight frye . he played renfield in dracula , and here he is very , very similar - - though he plays a much more harmless weirdo . in this case , he ' s obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths . the film does a good job of providing some " red herrings " ( i . e . , false leads ) and while it doesn ' t take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible , the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film . in addition , while the production had little money to speak of , it still had some good actors of the day - - lionel atwill and melvin douglas - - and it also used universal studios sets at night ( when they were done filming for the day ) . as a result , the film looks pretty good overall , though i also thought that , as usual , fay wray was terrible - - thought it didn ' t noticeably detract from the film . i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth - - she always seems to be cast as the " screaming lady " and provides little new in each film . < br / > < br / > overall , for fans of old horror films , this is excellent and worth seeing . for people who are not fans of the genre , it ' s probably pretty skip - able . 
POS she ' s not michael jordan < br / > < br / > think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth . their names might trip as easily off the public ' s lips as russell , cousy , byrd , magic , mchale , oscar , wilt , the list goes on ; but the volume gets turned down a little , for stockton and malone , charles , patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael . < br / > < br / > i ' ve seen it written that gretchen mol ' s career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms . mol . it was later said that she had been over hyped . i disagree . < br / > < br / > i still remember that for some time after i saw " the devil ' s advocate " in ' 97 or ' 98 , i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax . was it mol or theron ? oh yeah ! charlize theron was the one in " 2 days in the valley " and " mighty joe young " and gretchen mol was in " donnie brasco " , " celebrity " , and " rounders " . < br / > < br / > by the time i had seen " the thirteenth floor " ( mol ) and " sweet november " ( theron ) , i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer . both were highly talented , had sweet faces , similar body types , short blonde hair and so on . < br / > < br / > theron , though , was offered more work . i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating . < br / > < br / > in 2003 " monster " was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself , all of filmdom knew who the " best actress " award was going to . and deservedly so ! theron was aileen wuornos . the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby ' s head . and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive ! unheard of ! < br / > < br / > then in 2005 " the notorious bettie page " was released . mol ' s performance was extraordinary . maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms . theron . it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate , nobody came and nobody cared . it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale , once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a " b " movie . ho hum ! no , no , no ! wrong ! no matter what you may think of the film ( and i enjoy films about the fifties ) if you pass on this one you ' ll be missing one of the better performances of that year . ms . moll was every bit as much bettie as ms . theron was aileen . unfortunately aileen , to the film - going public , is the more sympathetic character . for whatever reason , an amoral , sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a naïve , unsophisticated , uninhibited , religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed . bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties . her photos and films never sexual , never pornographic , but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky . there was no sense of realism , only parody . ms . moll captured the very essence of the character . she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film , her body was bettie ' s . her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie . cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality . in this film it ' s all about innocence . seeing gretchen / bettie nude didn ' t make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other . if you pass on this film you ' ll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years . by the way , shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating . 
POS i ' ve known about bettie page for many a year now . the soft - core porn images of her from the 1950 ' s have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today . the " bettie page " look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then . so i watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with . the result did not disappoint . < br / > < br / > among other things , it was hugely entertaining to see the movie ' s recreation of actual figures like irving klaw , john willie , and bunny yeager  all consider trailblazers today . mary harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950 ' s america along with a sexuality that , by today ' s standards , was innocent in the extreme . i particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate bettie found herself in . < br / > < br / > i think that gretchen mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naiveté . bettie loved to look pretty , loved the attention , saw nothing wrong with nudity , and enjoyed dressing up in " silly outfits " for the camera . the underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her . to this day she still doesn ' t understand " what all the fuss was about " when it comes to her pictures or the s & m content of them . < br / > < br / > this isn ' t to say she ' s uneducated or too simple to understand it ' s just that she simply doesn ' t " get it " about fetishism and never will . no harm there . bettie page is simply being who she is . the film captured this quite nicely . < br / > < br / > the social atmosphere of the 1950 ' s depicted by ms . harron and written by her along with guinevere turner makes me truly glad i live in the day and age that i do . the hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world . the film well captures this and brings to cheering as bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naiveté . < br / > < br / > this film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points ms . harron attempted and hit them well . i ' d recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who bettie page was and what effect she had on american culture . for those with such interests , then this film is a must see . 
POS first , let me say that notorious is an absolutely charming film , very lovingly rendered of its time and subject ( s ) . gretchen mol is utterly , painfully convincing , the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by ms . page herself . irving and paula klaw are richly drawn as the working - class stiffs they were ( having met paula at movie star news in 1990 i can say that lili taylor ' s performance is unimpeachable ) , and jared harris as john willie ( coutts ) is an adoringly debauched genius . anyone with an interest in the recorded history of american attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie , in a theater preferably , where votes made with dollars count more . < br / > < br / > second , i will allow that i am a producer of material similar to that for which the klaws would become famous , which is no way affects my estimation of ms . harron ' s work as the splendid piece that it is , but does condition my view of notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order . ms . harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion . along with v for vendetta , it is a movie about another time for our times . < br / > < br / > few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in notorious ( through transcription of the very words uttered in closed senate committee hearings ) is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now . while ms . harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film , her faithfulness to the facts , and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them , synchronizes notorious with the present day . the very acts that notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the communications decency act , recently brought to the supreme court as a first amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the bush administration . in other words , the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in notorious is indictable today by federal prosecutors in whatever ( hostile ) jurisdiction they choose . of course , there were no hearings in the senate or elsewhere on this matter when the cda was passed . of course you know nothing about it , because you don ' t want people in peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at ( likewise , people in peoria probably don ' t want me telling them what they ' re allowed to view ) . of course notorious will never be indicted . it ' s hollywood . it ' s lawyered up . countless klaws will , however , continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic , moral or biological composition much in 50 + years . < br / > < br / > in addition , notorious posts no 18 usc 2257 compliance statement , which is mandated by the unnoticed " earmark " recently voted into law . if any media contains images of " sadomasochistic restraint " it is required to make available ( ex warrant ) records of age and circumstance of all performers . notorious fails in this regard also . < br / > < br / > in addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an ( nearly ) accurate historical document , notorious will be the litmus against which the bush justice department is itself judged with respect to the 14th ( equal protection ) amendment and on perhaps several other constitutional grounds . in this regard alone , a debt of gratitude is owed mary harron . you ' ll be grateful in any case , constitutional or otherwise , if you see this film . 
POS " the notorious bettie page " is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america . bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america . the type of modeling bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a u . s senate investigation in the 1950s . < br / > < br / > walking out of the film , all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s . you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot , that the footage questioned in " the notorious bettie page " seems almost childlike and innocent . most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals . i find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today ' s pornography , it was very tastefully done . < br / > < br / > to be honest , i was pretty impressed with " the notorious bettie page , " i found the film to be very well done and interesting . the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america . gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance . i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s . < br / > < br / > my only complaint about the film was the running time , there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been . i looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival . also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie page ' s life where the film left off . those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid , the acting was great especially gretchen , and the writing was good . < br / > < br / > mary harron , who directed " american psycho " , which is one of my favorite films , is the director and writer of " the notorious bettie page . " i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like " psycho " , bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that . harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters . she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to come . < br / > < br / > bottom line : " the notorious bettie page " is definitely worth a look . it ' s a very interesting story that shows how far america , as well as the world , has come in terms of pornography . the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head . and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands . sadly , this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think it ' s worth checking out . < br / > < br / > moviemanmenzel ' s final rating for " the notorious bettie page " is a 8 / 10 . it ' s an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history . 
POS this movie will not sit well with some , but it is a must view . i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as " other " african americans moved in . < br / > < br / > ( minor spoilers ) < br / > < br / > this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint . . . you have an african american male ( danny glover ) who worked his way hard through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970 ' s . like any american , he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot , there was still alot of problems going on . the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids . one owning a home ? wow . < br / > < br / > then the blending in began . his wife ( whoopi goldberg ) is told to " get involved " so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do . and just when the man thinks he and his family are " in " , right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the " lotto " ( mo ' nique ) , and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesn ' t want the neighborhood to think they are alike . he , of course is of a better calibre , his new neighbor is " ghetto " not an shouldn ' t be there ! who ' s got a problem now ? < br / > < br / > what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in , and how they lose themselves in the process . it makes you question where does racism begin and end . . . and with whom . it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have , you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you . it also shows how these african american children , when " blending in " neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture ( complete with blonde hair and blue eyes , mind you ! ) around them . they laugh along with the jokes , not knowing they are the joke and not knowing . . why . < br / > < br / > but overall , this film is about ' people ' . no matter what race you are , this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other . . . all for the sake of fitting in . . all because you feel you have more money than others , so that automatically makes you better - - and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you . < br / > < br / > again , not for everyone . but take a look and judge for yourself . < br / > < br / > 
POS short , but long enough , cat soup is a very wild trip to watch . one day , i was just searching though my on - demand list through the anime section and came across it , and decided to watch it . i spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw agape . the whole time i was either vacant of thought , or had a fleeting one which screamed " turn it off ! ! ! " . but i didn ' t . and actually , i ' m glad i did . < br / > < br / > the animation is stunning . very artistic , odd and dark . i personally loved it for the amazing animation , but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myself . < br / > < br / > a young boy - - well , cat - - goes in search of his sister ' s soul . in the first part she ' s lying sick in bed , and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper . her soul is split in half . one is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lost . < br / > < br / > then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me , honestly . i expect they go back , and their world is . . . perhaps slowly falling apart ? maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this , for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world ' s in . first there ' s a giant flood , and next it dries up into a bleak desert , and then everything freezes ( thanks to either what is god or fate , as you will see ) . then i believe they find the sister ' s soul in the form of an orange flower . after that , the whole world disappears . haha , totally didn ' t get that , but it sends shivers down my spine each time . < br / > < br / > despite it ' s seemingly random scenes , i ' m sure there ' s a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research . personally , i love trippy stuff like this , and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it . but to some people it ' s probably not their cup of tea . it comes off as highly disturbing , so if you like your straight forward anime , this is not a film for you . if you have an open mind however , i highly recommend this movie . 
POS first of all , this movie is 34 minutes long , which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies . second of all - - you need to do this . this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images . cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant , a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky , and pigs eating their own fried flesh - - that ' s only the beginning . the scenes and images , extraordinary on their own , flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re - watching . furthermore , the dvd includes an amazing director ' s commentary , which , given the extremely spare dialog , only enhances the viewing . the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes , but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup , along the lines of : " well , the artists were asking what we should do in this scene , but i didn ' t know myself , so its hard to say why it turned out as it did " ( that ' s a bad paraphrase by the way ) . also , the sound throughout the film is very high quality , very precise , and very moody . in all , the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows : < br / > < br / > first viewing : watch the dvd without the commentary . second viewing : watch the dvd with the commentary . third viewing : rewatch without the commentary . < br / > < br / > once you ' ve watched it three times , however , you ' re not going to stop there . . . 
POS this project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular japanese manga slamdunk ! and that ' s not something new to jay chou , who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga initial d . along the way , it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie , so hence the title , even if the idea wasn ' t very original , with stephen chow ' s shaolin soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined . < br / > < br / > however , and thankfully , those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum , and in kung fu dunk , really quite unnecessary , because they don ' t add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement , and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when stephen chow used kung fu in football games . jay chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist fang shi - jie since it ' s not the first time he fought using martial arts ( curse of the golden flower anyone ? ) , and under the stunt direction of ching siu - tung , he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer , just to let you know who ' s boss . < br / > < br / > that was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner , and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot , able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle . and with eric tsang as a small time hustler chen - li who sees his potential and becomes his agent , he joins a university to play varsity basketball , but not without the initial objection of team captain ting - wei ( chen bo - lin ) and team star xiao - lan ( baron chen , in his big - screen debut ) . but you know with team members on the same side , it ' s not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court . < br / > < br / > and i will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how goal was to football . it made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters , despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts . here , special effects and wire - work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the nba league , and in all honesty , really looked stunning , especially when they mimic various dunking moves , and performing combo - moves thanks to technology and stunt work . so in actuality , the kung fu elements don ' t really have to be in the movie . the stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they ' re quite grounded to reality , only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk . < br / > < br / > pity too that the number of games were only a handful , with the time spent on plenty of subplots , but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please . things like the abandoned shi - jie ' s quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them , that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games , and his love life with charlene choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else . everyone ' s acting a little too cool , leaving little room for main characters to add depth . one of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability , and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court , than only on it , and during competitive games , apart from the high - fives and friendly passes . < br / > < br / > with the us $ 10 million budget , it is easy to see where the money went to - the effects , in particular , a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie . it ' s quite flawless , nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone , but again i like to emphasize , that even without those elements , the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves . and having jay chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success . 
POS to many people , beat street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culture . < br / > < br / > the young lee is living in ny in the 80 ' s when hip hop was at its beginning . his a crew member of " beat street " - a b - boy crew . the movie follows lee in his average day , dancing , graffitiing , etc . < br / > < br / > the director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world . the movie has old school features such as < br / > < br / > afrika bambaataa & the soul sonic force , grandmaster melle mel & the furious five , the rock steady crew , the new york city breakers , and many more . . . . < br / > < br / > neither the movie beat street nor the beat street spirit will ever die . 
POS just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion ( and justice ) to the movie . < br / > < br / > first of all , to get things straight , this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie . it doesn ' t aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one . if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest , i suggest you discard your critical - mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you won ' t find any in here . with that established , let us further into the movie . < br / > < br / > i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didn ' t have a strong plot ( yes , moviegoers , i underrated this movie as well ) , but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much . i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flicks ( which i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and would ' ve rated it a 9 as well ) . action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places . < br / > < br / > spoilers alert , i think the action might be unreal , but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways ? there are a lot other sports movies ( drama ) that already did it well , why create another ? spoilers end < br / > < br / > i ' m not even sure why you ' re reading this . go ahead and watch it . just remember , no thinking - just watch , enjoy , smile , laugh , and < br / > < br / > every once in a while they ( the movie industry ) creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies , and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump . i ' m not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have , then again , if we ' re talking about stephen chow - ish comedy , this one ' s a top ten . < br / > < br / > highly recommended if you love : - no brainer movies with really good action - kung fu - death trance - kung fu and comedy - what the heck , watch this . you ' ll have a great time . < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 for you the cast of kung fu dunk . ^ _ ^ 
POS the movie is absolutely silly . < br / > < br / > but were you expecting a high - brow intellectual film based on a comic called slam dunk ? really ? jay chou ' s acting isn ' t exactly the most moving thing i ' ve ever seen , but i certainly enjoyed the movie . was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen chow can produce ? no , not really . was it thoroughly entertaining if you ' re just taking it at surface value ? absolutely . it ' s a movie about some chinese eye - candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise . there ' s an evil triad - style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay chou involved in all of this . a love interest . it ' s formulaic but really , suspend disbelief for a while . come on . it ' s called kung fu dunk . what do you really think you signed on for ? do yourself a favor if you watch it - i found myself a copy with some engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise , but we got a great laugh out of it . they would appear to be extremely fixated on jerusalem and the numbers 1 , 10 . < br / > < br / > i laughed , i cried , i hurled . i ' d watch it again . < br / > < br / > especially for that fight scene in the bar . well choreographed and well shot . i especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - i ' d love to play on one of those . < br / > < br / > slick enough for me , but i dig on trash cinema . 
POS " lost " , " 24 " , " carnivale " , " desperate housewifes " . . . the list goes on and on . these , and a bunch of other high - quality , shows proves that we ' re in the middle of a golden age in television history . " lost " is pure genius . incredible layers of personal , and psychologically viable , stories , underscored by sublime cinematography ( incredible to use this word , when describing a tv - show ) , a killer score , great performances and editing . anyone who isn ' t hooked on this , are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever . it may have its problems , when watching only one episode a week , but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this . hope they keep it up ( as i ' m sure they do ) . 
POS here is an innovative television drama ; which so easily blends a compelling story , brilliantly drawn out character development , humour , romance , and drama into each episode . here is a show that sings to it ' s own tune , whether it ' s audience chooses to follow or not . how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next ? where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works , that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula ( prison break , 24 , and desperate housewives come to mind ) - lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula , the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling . this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television . this is how it ' s so defiant of conventional tv . and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television . forget the naysayers - lost is , has been , and always will be , there to appease it ' s cult following first and the general public next . but it ' s a testament to it ' s inventiveness that it ' s garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences . 
POS a very addictive series . i had not seen an exact combination among drama , action , suspense and sci - fi never before . i am impressed every chapter . the screenplay is very intelligent , i don ' t know how the creators invent all this amazing stories , every character have a strange past , troubles , stormy relationships , it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters . < br / > < br / > the most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them : the numbers , they have met before without knowing it , and so on . the others , enigmatic security system and the darma initiative are elements that don ' t let us lose a chapter . < br / > < br / > mr . jj abrams , what did you think to create this amazing story ? 
POS lost is the best tv series there is . first of all , it has great actors and wonderful directing . the writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex . for instance , who is jacob ? why are there polar bears on the island ? what ' s the fog ? how did the island disappear ? who is richard alpert ? a lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can ' t explain . i believe these people are wrong . i have confidence in the writers . i think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone . anyway , lost is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time . 
POS i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979 . i ' m still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis , right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face . sometimes its scary how much he looks , acts , and talks like the real elvis . thankfully this is being released on dvd , so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film . i have heard the detractors , who say that there are some inaccuracies , or some things left out , but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 1 / 2 hours to work with , and that this was being shown on television ( just two years after elvis ' s death ! ) that he did a fine job with this . in fact i haven ' t seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one . highly recommended . 
POS not really a big box office draw , but i was pleasently surprised < br / > < br / > with this movie . james " i did some things to farrah fawcett " orr < br / > < br / > co - wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary , average guy < br / > < br / > named larry burrows who thinks his life would have been < br / > < br / > incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game < br / > < br / > when he was 15 . but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender < br / > < br / > mike , larry gets his wish , yet soon realizes that his new life < br / > < br / > isn ' t exactly as he hoped it would be . < br / > < br / > i must say , this movie really impressed me . critics have given < br / > < br / > it mixed , and i must say the concept is really interesting and < br / > < br / > pulled off well . yes , it is a little standard , but packs enough < br / > < br / > funny moments , drama and excellent acting to make it really < br / > < br / > good . james belushi ( i think ) was oscar worthy for his role . jon < br / > < br / > lovitz is perfect , and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine in < br / > < br / > their roles . michael caine is perfect as the bartender . it ' s < br / > < br / > just a good movie with a good lesson . if you ' ve never seen , i < br / > < br / > highly recommend you check 
POS the movie " holly " is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and smuggled across the border to cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous " k11 " red light village . in the movie , holly is waiting to be sold at a premium for her virginity when she meets patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights . patrick and holly have an immediate bond over their " stubbornness " , but this is all disrupted when holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears . as movie goers , we are then thrust into patrick ' s pursuit to find holly again . holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong . " holly " carries us through the beautiful and harsh cambodia while discovering that holly is not just one girl . she is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protection . < br / > < br / > holly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest , such as documentaries that involve 4 - year olds and sexual trafficking , but does manage to shed considerable light on cambodian / vietnamese trafficking of children into prostitution . it is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrong . < br / > < br / > patrick , the antagonist of the film is an american dealer of stolen artifacts who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights . while on a journey , his motorbike runs out of fuel , and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel . during his stay he comes across holly , a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being abducted into slavery and prostitution . holly and patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding . he discovers a clever , stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her - - though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet . when she suddenly disappears , he starts a journey to track her down , without having thought if he can really help her . < br / > < br / > holly is able to escape on her way to another brothel , when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines . a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead , so holly is then left on her own . during patrick ' s journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that haunts the cambodian region . the idea of paying for her freedom simply fuels the demand , she explains : 30 , 000 children in prostitution in cambodia - next year it could be 60 , 000 . " i ' m not trying to save 60 , 000 , " he tells her , " i ' m trying to save one . " patrick discovers that the idea of whisking her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the us will not let him adopt and , although it takes five minutes to ' save ' a child , it takes five years to reintegrate her into society . patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find holly . < br / > < br / > the audience is then shown that holly makes it to a small town and is foraging for food with other homeless children . she is then befriended by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a badge , when they sell her to another brothel and then make a deal to a vietnamese businessman who then takes her virginity . holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when patrick finally find her , she is willing to " yum yum " and " boom boom " her distant friend . patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior , but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world . in the end , he steals her away and brings her to a safe - land in the comfort of the social worker . holly is given fresh clothes , if feed and brought to a dance class , but she is forbidden to see patrick . this intense yearning to be in the comfort of patrick ' s friendship , she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in cambodia . < br / > < br / > meanwhile , patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the united states or to stay in cambodia . his thoughts continue to revert back to holly and during a visit to a bar ; an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual appetite when he had sex with her . this enrages patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar . eventually , patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of holly , who is hiding behind a pole . < br / > < br / > the movie " holly " may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters , and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region , but the film ' s dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference . overall , i think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie . the actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle , but in the end , the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation , does nothing to help the children ' s situations . 
POS as did others in this forum , when " fobidden planet " was offered in 1956 , i rushed to see it . this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young , old , male , female , sci - fi experts and people who find such fare ' way out " all can follow and enjoy this film ' s story and plot lines very well . this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as " flash gordon " . leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role , at that time , but walter pigeon , marvin miller , anne francis , richard anderson , earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well . there are so many visual splendors in this one , it ' s hard to choose a favorite from the film ' s scenes . the approach to altair - 4 , the starship itself , the landing on the planet ' s alien surface , the descent via extensor stairs , the first view of the landscape , the approach of the rocket - sled , dr . morbius ' s house seen from without and from within , the underground complex and its wonders , the setup of the weaponry , the battle with the monster , the final approach of the unseen destroyer , the escape from the doomed planet - - all these scenes are etched into the viewer ' s mind because we discover them along with the participants . veteran cyril hume ' s literate script was filmed intelligently by long - time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination . it is a shock to realize there ' s no music at all ; the film is carried by the words , the actors and the mystery - revelation storyline . it can be watched again and again with pleasure - - i have been doing so for nearly fifty years . until this famous and well - loved film was created , no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth ; and for decades afterward , ships kept crashing back on the planet - - as if the writers ' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes . still the best , many say . that says something negative about this nation ' s so - called intellectual leaders ' imaginations - - and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem . 
POS sure star wars ( a movie i have seen at least fifty times ) beats all the others in special effects , but this film has every thing else ! < br / > < br / > it has horror ( non - graphical ) , romance , robots , witty repartee , intelligence , ( surprisingly good ) special effects , and drama . < br / > < br / > i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print , and i was amazed at how well it held up today . i thought the old 40 ' s style electronics would look hokey , but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne . < br / > < br / > ann francis in here ( mostly ) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me . < br / > < br / > the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me . < br / > < br / > of course we all know that the " great bird of the galaxy " probably modeled much of " star trek " from this movie . < br / > < br / > no one has yet to beat robby , the robot , in terms of personality < br / > < br / > ( sorry , r2d2 and c3po ) . < br / > < br / > this movie , overall , is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to ! < br / > < br / > honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles . 
POS an excellent interpretation of jim thompson ' s novel , this neo - noir thriller has all the requisite elements - - deranged ex - boxer turned drifter , alcoholic widow with sinister desires , ex - cop turned small - time crook , and a kidnap plot destined for doom . yet , the film never crosses into cliche country , but remains fresh and intriguing . the performances are all superb , particularly bruce dern ' s role as the wicked sleazeball , uncle bud . there is a tense uncertainty to the film ' s movement which , intentional or not , adds to the grim proceedings . highly recommended . 
POS tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did . it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years . no grant character transformations , no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic . the balance , in speed , in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed . this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was . the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied . the fact that this film is about nothing , merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters , makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining , it is brilliant because it is empty . in between the lines it is happening . to see or not to see , that ' s the ? 
POS i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival . to pick up on the previous reviewer ' s remarks , the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space , drab architecture , overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe . a bit shabby housing project style is how i ' d describe it , and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities . i can ' t say that i ' m familiar with bucharest , romania where the action unfolded , but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months . < br / > < br / > when i visited russia as a student for a semester , my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building , just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman , because the elevators weren ' t working . but , i do concur with the reviewer , that the claustrophobia and muted colors , it ' s overdone , for there are , to be sure , beautiful historic buildings , parks , squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe , and bucharest ' s didn ' t get much of any footage in this film . for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half - year stay there , feeling trapped and limited . ( it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life , just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto . ) < br / > < br / > also , given the climate of homophobia , say , circa , us in the 1980s , the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter ; hence , the focus on their interaction in the apartment . < br / > < br / > it ' s remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania , and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing . it ' s unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film , and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources . the actors were fairly good and believable ; the dialog was overall well done , and i could identity with these women . < br / > < br / > the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women , kiki , an energetic , fun - loving free spirit with a dark , troubling secret ( her admiration and love for an abusive , incestuous brother , sandu ) falls in love with alexandra , a bright , bookish , idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies . opposites attract , and their personalities seem to complement one another , though there is some tension between the ambitious , studious , intellectual alexandra and kiki , who seems to be attending college to please her parents . keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable , though we don ' t get any sense of the tension it requires , nor do we ever see or meet any other students - - hard to believe - - and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed . the chief threat to their love is kiki ' s brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him . but kiki ' s love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond , or does it ? that ' s what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops , and i won ' t say how it concludes . < br / > < br / > ironically , kiki ' s love " sickness " isn ' t love for another woman , but her illicit , incestuous love for her brother . thus , loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling . < br / > < br / > though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic , overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra , it was still engaging and moving to watch , so i ' ll give it a 7 . 
POS very slow - paced , but intricately structured and ultimately very touching . a nice , very true - to - life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter - - i ' ve been there , and this is absolutely accurate . < br / > < br / > it ' s also the debut feature of actress ashley judd , and she makes a big impression here . it ' s hard to believe this film is 12 years old - - i remember seeing it in theaters , and i recently rented " ruby " again . except for the 80 ' s looking clothes , it has held up very nicely . ashely is so radiant and touching here , that it ' s hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing . boy , talk about failing to fulfill your early promise ! anyone seeing ashley here in " ruby in paradise " would assume this elegant , natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting - - instead she has become the " go to " girl for dumb action films and slasher movies ! very disappointing , but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise . < br / > < br / > as some other commenter ' s say , this is not for everyone as it ' s very slow paced . this is not an action film , nor is it really a romance . the director ( victor nunez , " ulees gold " , another excellent character study ) treats this ordinary young woman ' s life with deep respect , allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail . in that way , i think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming - of - age stories about young women that i can recall - - it ' s not about ruby ' s sexual awakening or " how she lost her virginity " , but about her life choices and her growing maturity . < br / > < br / > a lovely film , if you take the time to watch it . . . i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls ( or boys for that matter ) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it . < br / > < br / > particular kudos to director nunez , who also wrote the script , which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female - written novel or memoir , but in fact it ' s mr . nunez ' s original work . rated 8 out of 10 . 
POS what is " cry freedom " like ? it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people . main character of the story is donald woods ( kevin kline ) , chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa . woods writes several articles , where he speaks critically about views of steve biko ( denzel washington ) . soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa ( right from the top , even from the chief of police ) . when biko dies in police custody , woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it . but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place , so world can find out the truth . < br / > < br / > attenborough managed to make a good movie about people , with main message that black and white are the same , cause we are all people . story leads us to south africa and this ( movie ) is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i ' m disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie . this is movie from which we all can learn something . although it is a bit long , this story couldn ' t be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko . < br / > < br / > also relationship between woods and biko was shown great , just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through . but sometimes sacrifices must be made ( biko ' s death ) so the truth could be reveled ( woods book ) . 
POS " crush " examines female friendship , for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme ( e . g . , " steel magnolias " ) . at the same time , it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise . the events depicted were highly improbable , but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me . not a film for the speeding - vehicle - and - explosion crowd , but grown - up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears . 
POS an overlong , but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods . the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men , and how they help each other out , but the second half isn ' t as strong , due to the elimination of the biko character . still , its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington , in the film that put the latter on the map . washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time . overall , a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit . 7 / 10 . ____________________________________ 
POS canto 1 : how kriemhild mourned over siegfried and how king attila woos her through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlarn : kriemhild ( margarete schön ) insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband , hagen tronje ( hans adalbert schlettow ) , but her brother , king gunther ( theodor loos ) , refuses her request . when king attila of the huns woos kriemhild through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlar , she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her . hagen tronje hides the nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake . < br / > < br / > canto 2 : how kriemhild takes leave from her homeland and how she was received by king attila : kriemhild brings some earth from where siegfried died , and travels to the court of the huns , where she is welcomed by attila himself , who also promises through oath to defend her . < br / > < br / > canto 3 : how king attila besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers : when kriemhild delivers a baby boy , attila returns to his realm and asks kriemhild what she would like most to please her . she asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom . < br / > < br / > canto 4 : how kriemhild receives her brothers : kriemhild insists on having the head of hagen tronje , but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request . < br / > < br / > canto 5 : how the huns celebrated the summer solstice with the nibelungen : kriemhild asks attila to kill hagen tronje , but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert , a guest is considered sacred . kriemhild offers gold to the hums for the head of hagen tronje . there is a fight , and hagen tronje kills attila ' s son . < br / > < br / > canto 6 : the nibelungen ' s distress : the huns lose the battle against the nibelungen , but keep them under siege inside attila ' s castle . kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver hagen tronje , but her brother gunther tells that german people are loyal with their friends . < br / > < br / > canto 7 : the nibelungen ' s end : after the death of rüdiger von bechlarn , giselher and gernot , hagen tronje and guhther are finally captured . kriemhild kills hagen tronje , ending her revenge with the destruction of the nibelungen . < br / > < br / > the conclusion of the poetic saga of siegfried through " kriemhild ' s revenge " is also told through seven dramatic cantos . the nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy , adventure , romance and betrayal ; the second part is a dramatic story of hate , revenge and loyalty . the solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters , the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of fritz lang produced another epic ahead of time . margarete schön is impressive with a total different woman , obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish . the costumes that kriemhild wears are also very impressive , and her acting is based on her face and look . i was a little disappointed with the reaction of attila after the death of his only son , since i found it too passive . my vote is eight . < br / > < br / > title ( brazil ) : " os nibelungos  parte ii : a vingança de kriemshild " ( " the nibelungen part ii : kriemhild ' s revenge " ) 
POS here is proof of why mary pickford was ` america ' s sweetheart . ' in this rather complex drama , mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the ` hill - toppers . ' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful . she is even willing to take a bath . that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature ( 5 ' ) . < br / > < br / > tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges . she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time . tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone . why she agrees to help the ` hill - topper ' daughter is beyond me , but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret . pickford ' s close ups are wonderful . < br / > < br / > danish - born jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain . the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables ( or whatever ) at the movie screen . if forrest robinson ( who plays daddy skinner ) had worn a beard , he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam  wants you ! < br / > < br / > although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning , it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure ` americana . ' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian . recommended . 
POS i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing ! i mean there was nothing scary about this movie ! it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious ! i think they shoudln ' t have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs . jason . although some parts were gross ( like the head blowing up ) . and any elm street film from 1 - 5 sucked . this was the best besides number 1 . i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror . but if you have nothing else to do rent this and you ' ll laugh alot . i want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary . freddy ' s dead the final nightmare overall grade : b - 
POS ok - i admit . i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks , the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable , but reasonable plot . < br / > < br / > starting out , we ' re introduced to the three lead females of the movie . one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married . a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about . the third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex ' s . < br / > < br / > they are almost the " first wives club " , and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex ' s involved as well as some " he left the credit card " behaviour . characters set - the movie continues . < br / > < br / > mcdowell ' s character , the headmistress , arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist , filling in for the regular player ( doughty ) catches her eye . what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief ? will they live happily ever after ? < br / > < br / > a tissue or two recommended if you ' re the teary type - the end uplifting , but maybe not what you ' d expect . all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action , special effects and schlock horror . 
POS crush provides a combination of drama , humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart . mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty - something friends in a small town in england . all three professional women down - out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin , fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos . andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british ( which is where i find she exudes the most ) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man . small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends ( great supporting cast ) conflicts with her relationship . unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness . keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that . this is the type of film you either love or hate , which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released . as i ' m sure most are just unearthing the film now . i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as " love actually " , and " three weddings and a funeral " . not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments . 
POS kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star , even though he keeps his pants on . < br / > < br / > the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life . i don ' t think i can think of another movie , except perhaps zeffirelli ' s romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well . < br / > < br / > the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously . in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery , without the mayhem . < br / > < br / > this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages . 
POS i ' ll be honest . i got this movie so i could make fun of it . i mean , come on , " hood of the living dead " ? what other reaction could i have ? the thing is , though , the movie ( and its makers ) decided that it wasn ' t going to be made fun of . instead , it was going to try its best to be a good movie . < br / > < br / > and you know what ? it came awfully close . a little less cheese in the incidental music , a little more professionalism in the photography , the acting , the incidentals ( like the props - - love the best buy bag ) . . . well , it ' s not a classic of the zombie movie genre , but it ' s still a pretty neat little movie on its own . and the acting , writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected . there ' s even some decent humor , as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead . < br / > < br / > if you can overlook the low budget ( which leaves its fingerprints in everything , alas ) and the almost constant profanity , this can be a pretty fun time at the movies . no , it ain ' t great . yes , it could have been better . but the makers , the actors , the crew , they all tried to make a good film ( instead of a camp classic ) and that counts for a lot . the line of campy zombie films is a mile long , and thank you , guys , for not adding to it . < br / > < br / > kudos to the quiroz brothers . i ' d love to see what they do next . and hey , somebody , give them a budget ! 
POS i love this tv series so much . it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful . i cant believe that they cut it off tv , and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not , apparently they survive , but i ' m not sure . cybersix was by far the best tv show ever . i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i ' m really glad i got to watch it . i luved it so much < 3 < br / > < br / > its about a women by the name of cybersix , she is not human . she goes by adrian sieldman , a man teacher at a highschool . now cybersix is actually a women , she is just disguised as a man in the day . by night cybersix patrols the city . < br / > < br / > a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix , and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her . < br / > < br / > if u have never watched it before u should totally download it . it was the best tv show in the world . why did they cut it off ? ? ? ? some people have issues . but i ' m glad i got to watch the 13 episodes . 
POS this is a really cool movie ! i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week . . . shadow was my favorite character in the movie . homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things . parts of the movie are sad though ( such as when sassy , the cat , falls down the waterfall , and when shadow falls in the hole at the end . ) i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first . shadow is the smart one , sassy is , well , sassy , and chance is the funny idiot . i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies , or talking animals . this is one of my top ten favorite movies ! 
POS i watch this movie all the time . i ' ve watched it with family ages 3 to 87 , and everyone in between ; they all loved it . it really shows the true scenes a dog has , and the love and loyalty you get from a pet . just beautiful . < br / > < br / > it ' s great for thoes who love comedy movies , the tear - jerker movies , or even just pets . < br / > < br / > the music is wonderful , the animals spectacular , the scenes truly thought out , and the characters perfect . what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities : shadow ( the oldest , a golden retriever ) he ' s the wise one , filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog , chance ( the american bulldog puppy ) is basically a puppy with a witty side , the comical character ; and sassy ( the hymilayan cat ) she ' s the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner , the real girly one . 
POS tony scott can make good films and bad , personally i think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother , but this is quite possibly his best film . < br / > < br / > what makes this film so great is that scott gives denzel ( on scorching form , better than training day ) and the revelation who is dakota fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness . the set up is absolutely not boring , although it takes time - it is involving , and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for radha mitchell as the mother . this all serves to make the action so much more effective , as we are so invested in the characters , for all their all too obvious weaknesses . this film has you on the edge for its entirety , and doesn ' t cop out at the end either . < br / > < br / > the film would of course be nothing without washington . i often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles , when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there ( i can only really think of one , daniel day lewis , who has more on - screen power these days ) . this film should have been huge , given his status and the strength of his performance , and the quality of the film . it just goes to show you that if a studio doesn ' t back a film to the hilt , it ends up going straight to video . i wish i ' d got the chance to see this on the big screen . 
POS yes , it ' s another great magical muppet ' s movie and i adore them all ; the characters , the movies , the tv show episodes ( it ' s the best comedy or musical tv show ever ) and all the artists behind it . but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i ' m surely talking about the weird ending ! ! < br / > < br / > i think it ' s very dangerous to involve that much , in american drama , and end a love affair by marriage ! ! we , as all the poor viewers , feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance , peevishness and misery ! so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie , superman and lois lane , dick tracy and tess , etc . so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe , serenity and peace . therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you ' ll be as mad as me ! < br / > < br / > they made the weak miserable creature ( kermit ) marry his daily nightmare , the most vexatious female ever ( miss piggy ) ! this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainment ' s industry ! and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage ( even the pathetic frog didn ' t have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything ! ) . therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious , grossing only 25 millions vis - à - vis 65 millions earned by the first one ( the muppet movie  1979 ) five years earlier ! ! < br / > < br / > simply in this movie they took manhattan , and my rest too !

POS when i first saw this film in the 1980 ' s , i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the " sesame street / muppets " age . i honestly don ' t remember if i liked it at the time or not . however , somewhere in college i watched this film again , and it wound up going ( and staying ) into my personal best films ever collection . < br / > < br / > this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets . i mean , obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there ' s humor geared towards both generations . but come on . . . janice is accidentally overheard telling someone " i don ' t take my clothes off for anyone , even if it is artistic " . . . there ' s a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn ' t want to hear it . . . gonzo saves a chicken with mouth - to - mouth resuscitation ( sp ? ) and afterwards says " i think we ' re engaged now " . . . these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling . add to that very smart dialogue , very smart new york / broadway " wink wink " humor , the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don ' t border on " kid - level cheesy " whatsoever . . . this film is a masterpiece ! i don ' t throw " 10 " ' s out on a regular basis . . . but this one deserves it . over 20 years later , this film totally holds up , perhaps even more so . the muppets never were and never will be again , as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is . - - - q 
POS i just saw this film on turner classic movies last night and was blown away by victor mclaglen ' s performance : in every sense of the word a " tour de force " . the atmosphere of 1922 dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the 40 ' s and early 50 ' s . very nice attention to detail also ; during frankie mcphillip ' s ( wallace ford ' s ) wake , the mourners are all praying in gaelic . max steiner ' s score is unforgettable . as in later films such as 1939 ' s gwtw , he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time . john ford : already a film giant in 1935 ! 
POS " return of the jedi " is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right , and that is a shame , because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling . it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale , and does so very convincingly . < br / > < br / > yes , there are ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit . but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga , where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader , the most recognizable villain in movie history . < br / > < br / > return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook : it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline ( which went from slightly implausible in the " empire strikes back " to very convincing here ) , an exciting opening at jabba ' s palace , a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor , luke finally coming into his own , the resolution of solo and leia ' s romance , and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon . < br / > < br / > yes , there are slight annoyances . but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who ' ve had time to nitpick every single scene . it ' s still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter . it ' s not a ' good ' movie - it ' s fantastic ! 
POS star wars : episode 4 . < br / > < br / > the best star wars ever . its the first movie i ever sean were the bad guys win and its a very good ending . it really had me wait hing for the next star wars because so match stuff comes along in this movie that you just got to find out more in the last one . whit al lot of movies i always get the feeling that it could be don bedder but not whit this one . and i will never ever forget the part were wader tels luke he is his father . way too cool . also love the bob feat figure a do hes a back ground player . if you never ever saw a star wars movie you go to she this one . its the best . < br / > < br / > thanks lucas 
POS this amazing oscar winner ( 4 in total ) and john ford ' s first academy award winner , is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner . called an art film , because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution , and greed and stupidity . but what makes this movie such a classic , is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting , that was so different from the usual american film , and more in the tradition of german expressionism . and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable . basically the movie takes place in ireland , and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend . but having all that money , he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away , while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer . the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland , and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along , the whole world of gypo is closing in on him , both psychologically . if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever , and nobody elses , john ford would certainly be one of them . what a truly remarkable movie . . . 
POS dear readers , < br / > < br / > the final battle between the rebellion and empire . the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance . luke skywalker , now a jedi knight , returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia , now revealed as luke ' s twin sister ! they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star . little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star . < br / > < br / > return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy . it ' s got action , drama , romance , great battles , fantastic acting , amazing fight scenes , and awesome music by john williams . mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight , gone is the naive farm - boy and in his place is a calm , relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy . leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando . 3p0 , r2 , and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema ' s greatest villain : darth vader . ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine . the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty . john williams ' s score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels . < br / > < br / > signed , the constant dvd collector 
POS i happened upon this movie as an 8 - 10 year old on a cold , dark november afternoon . i was outside playing all day , freezing , and when i came in around 4pm , i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket . i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn ' t all happy and silly - - and was in fact dark , and moralistic . it captured my imagination . i ' m sure it misses the text , and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist . but it still captures the spirit of the story , the choice to carry a burden for the good of others , the consequences of selfish , rash decisions , etc . the quality of animation leaves room for complaint . but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations . john hurt is great in this . if you don ' t like how the character is drawn , look away , and just listen to him . his voice is extraordinary . i ' ve seen it again many , many times and it always brings me back to that time , as a kid , thirsty for some magical adventure . it ' s for this reason i say ' lucky ' , the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings . but between john hurt , and tolkien ' s fantasy , it still reached me , and still does . 
POS things to come is an historic film . along with metropolis ( 1927 ) , it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles . it is also one of the first doomsday movies . it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year , and even , in a subtle way , the year it would end in the real world . but then the film departs from reality , depicting a world ravaged by war ( only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936 ) . < br / > < br / > the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight , making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings - - later to become staples of the science fiction genre . it is sad that , after things to come , sci - fi would become identified with cheaply made b - movies , a stereotype that wouldn ' t be broken until 2001 : a space odyssey more than 30 years later . if they ' d stuck with the quality of the effects in this film , things would have been very different in hollywood . < br / > < br / > raymond massey and some of his co - stars play multiple roles in this film , to good effect . massey plays a great " doctor who " - like role as a pilot from an advanced ( for 1970 ) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple - minded warlord ( a very effective performance by ralph richardson ) . ultimately , the storyline covers 100 years . but that ' s a big problem with this film - - there really isn ' t a cohesive storyline . < br / > < br / > perhaps in such an episodic film - - somewhat reminiscent of intolerance , actually - - it ' s hard to have a conventional plot , but i felt more could have been made of the material , and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission . . . the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting . maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci - fi innovation : a sequel ? < br / > < br / > things to come is a film every serious sci - fi buff should see at least once . unlike metropolis , however , it might not bear repeated viewings . 
POS things to come is an early sci - fi film that shows an imagined world , or " everytown " through 100 years . you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts . the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the " boss " wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again , after everytown was bombed and war broke out . < br / > < br / > this film only has about 3 faults : it ' s audio is muddy and video had some quirks , the characters aren ' t deep at all , and the overall plot isn ' t altogether solid . the plot is lacking something that i can ' t put my finger on . . . it just seems a little " fluffy . " but if you love sci - fi and are interested in what h . g . wells though might happened in the next hundred years , this is a must see . it ' s worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing : a long , drawn - out war , because they were just about to go to war with germany , and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything . < br / > < br / > things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once . 
POS the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses ; the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general , but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world . when war finally does arrive , it ' s ravages continue not for another five years , but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed . adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the " wandering sickness " , a pestilence that continues for another four years . < br / > < br / > " things to come " balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view , where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization . the " wings over the world " concept plays out a bit corny , though it ' s spokesman cabal ( raymond massey ) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause . if he fails , others will follow . this message is continually reinforced throughout the film , brought home convincingly in massey ' s end of movie speech . man ' s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an " all the universe or nothing " mindset . < br / > < br / > the film ' s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film " metropolis " . as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 , the spectacle of the city ' s rebirth strikes a resonant chord , as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie ' s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition . where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man ' s first mission to the moon , but in 1936 , a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 . < br / > < br / > " things to come " is one of those rarities in film , a picture that makes you think . which side will you come down on , the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo ? it ' s not a comfortable question , as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes . those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control . 
POS aside from the great movie metropolis , this is about the oldest pure sci - fi movie . while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad , it is a great film for two reasons . first , it is extremely original in both style and content . even in the 21st century , there are no films i can think of that are anything like it . second , for its time , the special effects were absolutely incredible - - using matte paintings , models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post - apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow . sure , you could sit back and knock the film because , by today ' s standards , the effects are only so - so . but , you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences . in many ways , the sets look highly reminiscent of the " modern cities " featured at the 1939 world ' s fair . < br / > < br / > i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question " are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness ? " the end result seems to be a little of both ! how true ! < br / > < br / > a final note : i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video . all three times the sound and print quality stank - - particularly the sound . if this is available on a dvd , hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning . as the sound on the video kept cutting out , i really would have appreciated this ! 
POS after ' ' empire strikes back ' ' ' ' return of the jedi ' ' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series . < br / > < br / > luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba . at the same time , the galactic empire is doing in secret , the construction of a new space station like the previous death star . if this station stays totally constructed , it will be the end of the rebel alliance . both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star , and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule . < br / > < br / > r2 and c3po are inside jabba ' s palace to send a message from luke to jabba , where lukes pretends to negotiate han ' s life . he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan . jabba does not accept the negotiation , since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace ' s decoration . ( han still is frozen in carbonite ) lando is hidden as jabba ' s guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter . when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again , we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise . the problem is that jabba discovers leia ' s plan and takes her as his slave , while han is thrown away in chewbacca ' s cell . < br / > < br / > luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends . at his first try to kill jabba , he falls into jabba ' s monster cell ( bantha ) , but easily kills it . jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han , chewbacca and luke to sarlacc , a big creature from the desert who stays 1 . 000 years digesting it ' s ' food ' . luke , han and chewie has success in scape again , and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc ' s mouth . leia kills jabba and goes after han , luke and chewie as well c3po and r2 . < br / > < br / > everybody ' s safe again , luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi , as well his promise to yoda . the problem is that yoda is too old and sick , since he already has 900 years old , and before he dies , yoda says to luke that he does not need more training , but to really be a jedi , he must fight with vader again . he confirms to luke that vader is luke ' s dad , and that there is another skywalker besides luke . in his last moments , yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side , and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people . when yoda dies , obi wan ' s spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke ' s father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader , and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith . luke stays worried about killing his own dad , and says that he feels that his father still has kindness . obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia , and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies . he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader , the emperor will win the war . < br / > < br / > at the same time , the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up , since luke is stronger than before , and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side . < br / > < br / > now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series , when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station , the ' ' death star 2 ' ' , luke will confront vader and the emperor , and leia , han and chewie needs to turn off the ' death star 2 ' power field , with the help of the ewoks . ( little creatures who looks little bears ) < br / > < br / > this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all ! 
POS i ' m too old to know ( or care ) exactly what the difference between rap and hip - hop is . and , being canadian , it ' s likely that i ' ve never actually seen mtv , but i ' m not certain . < br / > < br / > but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it , a bright little satire . hip - hop culture is so pervasive these days that it ' s difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over . ( if only we could say the same about bagpipe music . ) i got most of the jokes ( at least i think i did ) . sure , it ' s derived from spinal tap , but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment . just not the carpenters , they ' re sacred . 
POS i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies . i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted . to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot , the most suspense , surprises , most emotional , ( especially the ending ) and definitely the most episodic movie . i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower - moving , was not as episodic , and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie . < br / > < br / > it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole . i have heard many strange reasons such as : a ) because yoda died b ) because bobba fett died c ) because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d ) because darth vader was revealed < br / > < br / > i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely . first off , who cares if bobba fett died ? ? ? if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die . don ' t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas ' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be . his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie . . . you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett ' s name ! ! ! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think . . . secondly , many fans did not like yoda dying . sure , it was a momentous period in the movie . i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic . all the good guys can ' t stay alive in a realistic movie , you know . otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon . another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda ' s death . . well , nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope . ( many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy ) why was obi wan ' s death okay but yoda ' s not . . . hmmmmmmmmmmmm . . . . another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible . that is utterly ridiculous ! ! i can not believe this one ! ! first off , the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there . if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage . ( since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage ) they had swinging vines , ropes , logs set up to trip those walkers , and other traps . the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest . the only thing they had was their blasters . to add , it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves , they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest . i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros , the band of rebels , as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain , that would have been a great upset . lastly , if this scene was still unbelievable to you . . how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo , chewbacca , and the princess , being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view ! ! and not only that , the heroes , of course , always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters . the troopers must have very , very bad aim then ! at least in empire strikes back , the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers . don ' t believe me ? check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando ' s base . or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at ( somehow they missed ) as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star . < br / > < br / > the last reason that i care to discuss ( others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here . ) is that people did not like darth vader being revealed ! well , in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie . luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father , annakin skywalker . it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father ' s face because it made it complete . by annakin ' s revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side ( in his helmet ) and to the good person he was annakin skywalker ( by removing the helmet ) . the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about . in fact , that ' s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke ' s father . . . isn ' t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet ? < br / > < br / > on another note , i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse ( even if it is better ) that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves . i never go into a film with that deception in mind , i always try to go into a film with the attitude that " well , it might be better or worse that the original . . but i can not know for sure . . let ' s see . " that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was . < br / > < br / > i am not sure who criticizes these movies but , i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me ( except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite ) that it is rotj . i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading . < br / > < br / > bottom line , the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy . this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes . there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful , exciting , surprising , or all of the above . for example , the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day ! ! ! < br / > < br / > finally , i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky , insignificant details ( or see it as " just another sequel " ) to trash the movie such as " this movie stinks because luke is not in it ! " then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately . < br / > < br / > 
POS doctor feinstone is a dentist . he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool . suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant - he realises that behind everything clean , there is decay . he starts to torture his patients . . . corbin bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist - he is completely believable . there is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque . highly recommended . " the dentist 2 " is also worth checking out ! 
POS this two - parter was excellent - the best since the series returned . sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films , but what tv shows don ' t do that these days . what we got here was a cracking good sci - fi story . a great big ( really scary ) monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit , some superb aliens in the ood - the best " new " aliens the revived series has come up with , a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters ( complete with a couple of unnamed " expendable " security people in true star trek fashion ) , some large - scale philosophical themes ( love , loyalty , faith , etc . ) , and some top - drawer special effects . < br / > < br / > i loved every minute of this . 
POS after " star wars : a new hope " redefined science fiction , and " the empire strikes back " redefined " star wars " , it ' s hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two , but this one really does a nice job . the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one , with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films . then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what ' s going on in the war . there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion ' s final confrontation with the emperor . when the battle begins , the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it , and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films . this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy , with the most at stake for the rebellion . this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land ( including han solo , chewbacca , and leia ) , the battle raging on in space ( including lando ) , and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star , which leads up to another duel with darth vader . it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war , and there seems to be no escape . although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far - fetched , it didn ' t seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use , rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers , although they did have some luck fighting them . there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming , which may not be quite as stunning as that of " the empire strikes back " , but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well . with the light tone of " a new hope " and the more sinnister tone of " the empire strikes back " , this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale . the special edition for " return of the jedi " concentrated on what would have been nice to change , since not much of the original really needed it . fifteen years of technology advancements didn ' t seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned , and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter , but other than that it was good . the gaping non - threatening sarlaac ' s mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly - trap looking head that emerged , which definitely added to the suspense . also , the disco was taken out of jabba ' s palace , and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy , instead of just a small ewok village , which was the case of the original and that didn ' t really end a story this big the way it deserved . it ' s hard to say which of the three films was the best , but since it ' s all part of the same story , the over - all trilogy is like one big , outstanding film . a third must - see for film fans . 
POS for the life of me , why did this film receive an r rating ? ! while it is about flesh - eating zombies , believe it or not , it ' s actually a pretty good family - friendly film - - at least if your kids are age 10 and older . unlike the traditional zombie films , this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values - - albeit a bit twisted ! the language isn ' t a serious problem , there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids ( much like the old tv show " eerie , indiana " ) - - yet some knucklehead slapped an r rating one it ! believe me , most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film . < br / > < br / > the story is set in a parallel - type world . while the fashions , cars and mores appear circa 1953 , in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the " zombie war " and massive changes in everyday life . at school , kids are trained in armed combat and there ' s a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack " just in case " ! as for life outside of school , it ' s pretty weird as well , as people now have learned that zombies aren ' t such a bad thing ! heck , using shock collars and training , they can be made into slaves who can do your housework , clean streets , deliver milk or , in the case of a really sick guy , be your " special friend " . < br / > < br / > this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave ( played by billy connally ) . mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie ' s friend . dad , on the other hand , isn ' t convinced - - as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn ' t yet gotten over this ! ! funny , irreverent and unique - - this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience . 
POS even without speaking a word , billy connely is wonderful as a zombie . . . carrie ann moss as " mom " ? , even better . zombie girlfriends ? < br / > < br / > " . . . my father thied to eat me . . . i never tried to eat timmy . " < br / > < br / > and i thought dawn of the dead was good . it ' s kinda like airplane meets ( meats ? ) night of the living dead , sponsored by zomcom . . < br / > < br / > and don ' t forget my head coffin < br / > < br / > and fido in an aloha shirt is just way cool ! < br / > < br / > and yes , the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on . < br / > < br / > sufice it to say , it all really works ! 
POS when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very , very good ( and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga ) . having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective . the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor . it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmé and the love she felt for her children . actually while the new films ( especially episode ii ) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only . they make the old films seem even better . < br / > < br / > mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie . he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real . in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job . harrison ford is still good . however , you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit . he adds more comedy ( obviously inspired from raiders ) to the character which works brilliantly . in short han solo is better than ever . carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable . ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever . james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very , very good . < br / > < br / > in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous ( two ) movies but this was always lucas ' forté so that is really to be expected . the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise . it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax . < br / > < br / > the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks . these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in . besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery . < br / > < br / > all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant . also george lucas ' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance . < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 
POS this film takes place in the 1950s . according to this the dead ( called zombies ) have arisen to eat the living . however a company has developed a collar that , when put around the zombies neck , makes them docile and perfect servants . the robinsons mom helen ( carrie - anne moss ) , dad bill ( dylan baker ) and son timmy ( k ' sun ray ) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one . tim names the zombie fido ( billy connolly ) and becomes friends with him . but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong . < br / > < br / > as you can see this is - - among many other things - - a takeoff on the " lassie " series with fido being a stand in for lassie . timmy was named that for a reason ! every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here . my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him ! also it ' s a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful - - but dark secrets are tearing people apart . the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes ( moss is always in a dress ) - - the furnishings , settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors . even when the script becomes repetitious there ' s always something to look at . the script is good - - but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make . the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off . everyone here is excellent and right on target . even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job . moss is the best - - playing each line for all its worth - - - but never going overboard . < br / > < br / > this isn ' t for everybody ( of course ) . the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame . the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it ' s hard to take it seriously . so , for some people , this will really work . i give it an 8 . 
POS this film , along with westfront 1918 , are my favorite pabst - directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks ( such as pandora ' s box ) . it ' s probably because both are very similar to the neo - realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s . this style film called for using non - actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films . < br / > < br / > in this case , the film is about french and german coal miners , so appropriately , the people in the roles seem like miners - - not actors . the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco - german border . instead of one big mine , it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine , despite there being greater unemployment in germany . this , language differences ( illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene ) and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions - - resulting in a we vs . they mentality . later , an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing . risking their own lives , they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general . < br / > < br / > the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried , in vain , to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred . it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen . considering history , though , the film ' s impact was minimal at best . it ' s a real shame , as like this one , westfront 1918 , jáaccuse ( gance ) and all quiet on the western front ( milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion . so , from a historical point of view , it ' s an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing . 
POS one of the biggest hits of 1926 , brown of harvard is a exciting comedy / drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star . it ' s patented haines all the way : brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl . no one worked this formula like haines . a terrific comic actor ( little annie rooney with mary pickford , show people with marion davies ) , haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression . he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines ( with lon chaney ) and west point ( with joan crawford ) , where he repeats the formula . mary brian is good as the girl , jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate , ralph bushman is the rival . edward connelly , mary alden , david torrence , guinn williams , and grady sutton co - star . this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne ' s film debut as a yale football player ( but i never spotted him ) . haines was a top - five box office star starting with this picture through 1932 . it ' s a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost . he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time . 
POS as a 90 minute experience , it is not up to the standard of ` drive ' , as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the ` who am i ? ' academy , while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat ' em - up . however , those who enjoyed ` drive ' , ( and i thought it was wonderful ! ) , will undoubtedly enjoy this too . you certainly won ' t rewind back to the start and watch it all again , but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come . < br / > < br / > it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced , even if not in hong kong , and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets , time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo - ping and corey yuen kuei . if you sit through the first half hour and aren ' t sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat . bosch is magnificent , and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics , kicks and simple acts of bravery . < br / > < br / > if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy , then track it down and watch it . it ' s not shakespeare . in fact , it ' s less articulate than coolio in ` china strike force ' , but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - ( i ' m pretty sure there ' s no safe way to land directly on your head , or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car ! ? ) . < br / > < br / > 
POS everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in , as the father have got a new job in a computer company there . but no paradise would be complete without its snake . strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband , as it certainly holds secrets . the father is not a joiner , but pressure is on him to join , as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members . robert urich ' s good guy part is a bit tepid , but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles . suspenseful and well - made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson . look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet . the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for . i have seen this movie quite a few times . 
POS the life and time of little richard , as told by little richard , as produced and directed by little richard , was about as one sided as one of his songs . this is not a biography or even a docudrama , but does have good writing , great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard . all the music is by little richard , so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song . < br / > < br / > the movie covers his early childhood , carrys thru the formative years in music , the wild success and richard ' s throwing it all away to praise the lord . its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles , whom opened for him . < br / > < br / > my main objection is that his outrageous , counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time . some of his energy , which he still has , does not come across full force . he seemed tame , compared to what i remember of him at the time . < br / > < br / > the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing , to make the point about not having a decent place to change . < br / > < br / > if they had gotten into the " bronze liberace " as richard use to refer to himself in interviews , then there ' s a story . trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys , giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience , his headband . nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t . v . appearance you can find . little richard is always on 
POS this movie is so great . its set back in probably the 40 ' s and meg ryan ' s character struggles to be known as ' smart . ' plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie . and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it . everytime i watch it i feel happy . it ' s definitely a girl movie , and i ' m a girl , so i like it . i also love the music . the violin is awesome . but besides that i think it ' s a cute story and everyone should watch it . 
POS australian fred schepisi ( a cry in the dark ) directs this comedy / romance that is fun , relaxing , and set in the spring . you will laugh while watching this movie . tim robbins ( shawshank redemption , dead man walking ) is an auto mechanic , ed walters , with a high iq , which gets higher with the help of albert einstein , walter matthau ( grumpy old men ) and his academic friends nathan , kurt and boris . you can tell them by their preppie shoes . meg ryan ( sleepless in seattle , you ' ve got mail ) is catherine boyd , einstein ' s niece who is a competent , but not so confident mathematician . perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius . she thinks that if she marries someone with a high i . q . her kids will have a high i . q . as well , but she does not knows what she wants . between tim robbins cute smile and meg ' s cuteness this is a refreshing movie . i love sweet stories . people all ages should enjoy this movie . catherine is engaged to the jerk james moreland , who works in animal behavior , but is very stuffy . this is a love a first sight type situation , between the mechanic and the mathematician . witty lines and subliminal lines ! the cinematography is nice . princeton , new jersey is beautiful in the spring . with much help from all those brilliant men catherine falls for ed , without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic . < br / > < br / > favorite scenes : ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of einstein , nathan , kurt , and boris . ed and einstein riding on the motorcycle . nathan , kurt and boris letting all the research animals free ! < br / > < br / > favorite quotes : albert einstein : " don ' t let your brain interfere with your heart " . ed walters : " when was the last time he said " wahoo " " ? catherine boyd : " well i ' m sure i don ' t know " . this is a refreshing movie , i recommend it . i have the tape and every once and awhile i will watch it again . 
POS not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not , so beware : < br / > < br / > just a small but crucial thing to watch for , an intriguing possibility : the boys steal a green citroen at one point , for a joy ride , and return it to the owner having done purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car , hoping that the owner will crash . is it the very same car they steal much later from the picnicking family ? we know the original owner sold it . they drive off at the end on a dangerous road , one which i understand has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years . a whole new slant to the end of the film . < br / > < br / > on another matter , this film could have been called " scent of a woman " . i don ' t recall another film , certainly not american , that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner , much like the " nose " of a fine bordeaux . 
POS bertrand blier is indeed l ' enfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public . filmed with his fave duo ( depardieu and dewaere ) and the usual dose of sex ( miou - miou plays her typical role , at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever ) . in first " les valseuses " is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals . those who only are satisfied with family life , or simply know nothing more , the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that , it just let you think of all the usual things in life ( working for the car , being bounded at work etc . ) . it ' s a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we ' re living in . great job and it just makes you wish two things : dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu , he ' d better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him . timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some . . . 
POS the scenes are fast - paced . the characters are great . i love anne - marie johnson ' s acting . i really like the ending . < br / > < br / > however , i was disappointed that this movie didn ' t delve deeper into achilles ' s and athena ' s relationship . it only blossomed when they kissed each other . 
POS the scenes are fast - paced . the characters are great . i love anne - marie johnson ' s acting . i really like the ending . < br / > < br / > however , i was disappointed that this movie didn ' t delve deeper into achilles ' s and athena ' s relationship . it only blossomed when they kissed each other . 
POS ok , this movie was cool . i don ' t think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun . my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while , and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard , blow off the dust and pop it in . enjoyable all the way until the end , but a great concept . this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy . judgment is victory for robot jox . 
POS my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots . so i try to seek out movies that have robots . and this movie has robots . big ones . they beat the clang and bang out of each other , with the fate of nations hanging in the balance . it ' s really cool . you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget . it is very hard to dislike this movie . because of those big robots . they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers ! it made my girlfriend smile . and that is good enough for me . and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo : as the maniacal russian villain , whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they ' ve already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste " like blood " ( a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub - bela lugosi accent ) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on - screen . this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation . 
POS if you like mech war games it ' s pretty good . some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing . i ' ve enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i ' ve ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs . if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $ 350 to spare steel battalion . the movie is worth seeing at least once . there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there . less remakes and more original works . < br / > < br / > enjoy 
POS robot jox tries hard , but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together - - robot against robot , man against man , man against woman . the premise had potential , but it seems the script wasn ' t really given the couple of more drafts it needed . still , it was fairly good , for a science fiction action movie . part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman . for those who aren ' t familiar with the name , haldeman wrote the award - winning science fiction novel " the forever war . " it ' s considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels , right up there with robert heinlein ' s " starship troopers " and john steakley ' s " armor . " and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie , rather than giant robots . it ' s closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven ' s " starship troopers , " which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on . < br / > < br / > despite some assumptions , this really isn ' t based on homer ' s " iliad . " a couple of names are all they had in common . achilles having his robot ' s foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad , which didn ' t include achilles ' death . nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior . he was the mightiest , but also vengeful and petty . even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn ' t fit . he was named hercules , while the greek iliad would have had herakles . < br / > < br / > the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget . true , it wasn ' t comparable to " terminator 2 " a year later , but that movie cost ten times as much . the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in " the empire strikes back " and " return of the jedi . " better , in fact , than a lot of ray harryhausen animation , which is highly regarded , but quite dated . < br / > < br / > don ' t bring high expectations into this and you probably won ' t be disappointed . it ' s better than a lot of other low - budget flicks and even some big - budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts . 
POS my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience . film and alternative cinema ( small hall , with uncomfortable seats ; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match . < br / > < br / > there were many cliches used in the film , but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing . sound was also brilliant ( sometimes back being louder than dialogue ) . < br / > < br / > everything seemed to be in right place . and i loved the way how after - war - time was presented . real fun ! < br / > < br / > 
POS an absorbing ( although repetitive and rather didactic ) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up , where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option . but even here , in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and no future , that does not work , and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with , a simple act of charity , gives some reward , even if it just makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past . < br / > < br / > although there is little actual on screen violence , this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindedness of oppression ( politically and personally ) that does not make for easy entertainment . clearly based on a play , with a small cast , a broader more expansive relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience . 
POS ] haven ' t seen this film ? haven ' t even heard of this film ? it wouldn ' t surprise me . one of the few truly " independent " films produced in the last ten years , no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution . the independent company kino films , gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion , and the majority of major film critics didn ' t even bother reviewing it . i guess a movie based on a one act , one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today ' s market - and it ' s the intelligent film - lover ' s loss . < br / > < br / > for the record , both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations ( as did the cinematographer ) but the film received such little fanfare that i can ' t even blame the academy on that one . this is a film that is challenging , thought - provoking , and heartbreaking , and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it ' s own terms . taking that into consideration , it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment . director john berry wisely does not attempt to dress - up athol fugard ' s play . sure , we ' re given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots , but the film version of boesman and lena remains , on the whole , a story of two people living in inhumane conditions . < br / > < br / > stripped of their basic human rights , boesman ( glover ) and lena ( bassett ) have no one left to attack but each other . a third character joins them for awhile ( willie jonah , amazing in a largely silent role ) , but the film ' s focus never strays from the title characters and what they ' ve become . bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple , performances that simply could not be improved upon . vigorously and brutally stimulating , both intellectually and emotionally , boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video . hands down , the best film of the year 2000 . 
POS i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes , i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow , yet thoughtful actions of the story - telling . i am still a fan . . . . . with some minor pains . < br / > < br / > though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything ( sound familiar ? ) , i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow - dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly - ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans ( especially the character called wufei . . . i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera . get a counselor , will ya ? ) < br / > < br / > besides for the over - exaggerated drama ( i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors ) , this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again . i mean it can always be worse . it could be like the recent installment , seed . . . . . . eeeewwww , talk about mellow - dramatic . . . . i ' ll chat about that one later . 
POS a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia . there ' s a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes , but it works . the scares are very subtle , not the jump - cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films . the way the " scares " are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in " the uninvited " ( aka 4 inyong shiktak , directed by su - leon lee ) , but this isn ' t nearly to the same caliber . the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological . it ' s not perfect , but it does what it ' s supposed to do . i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance . 
POS i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart ! no other story had such a unfinished ending . . . i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites , because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness , and cruelty , and loneliness , and life , and choices that can ' t be undone , and the need for others . chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother , but the wolf is alone , too , when chirin follows him into the mountain . the wolf doesn ' t kill the lamb , even though each night he says " maybe i ' ll eat you tomorrow . " the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use . i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child . stories like this , with this depth and feeling , and this intricacy of meaning , are very rare . it is a sad story , but i ' ve never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made . i am glad i have seen this movie , and i ' m glad i saw it as a child . 
POS watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago , and now that i ' ve found it again it still has a film experience like few others . if risky , it ' s a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids . while it still holds up as an adult , i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago . trying to find it today is hard enough . . . but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age . anime fans especially will find this a great entry to masami hata ' s filmography . with impressive art work and unique designs , " chirin no suzu " represents a worthwhile experience . while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english , the musical score is nevertheless captivating . but even the voice acting is far better than much released today . unfortunately is went out of print in the mid - 1980s from rca columbia home video , and has not received any new format release to my knowledge , at least in the us . look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied ! it ' s an artful , intense , enjoyable , and important landmark in japanese animation . 
POS it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary . at times there is almost a desperation , as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound , surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside ( as did happen to some ) , rin - tin - tin . however , was pertfectly natural . in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences , some were sure to stand out john barrymore ' s soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving . by and large , only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence . however , this is over all reasonably entertaining , and a must for " film buffs " especially interested in the silent to sound transition 
POS way , way back in the 1980s , long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities , the united states and japan were at each other ' s throat in the world manufacturing race . remember sayings like ' union yes ! , ' ' the japanese are taking this country over , ' and ' americans are lazy ? ' < br / > < br / > as the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace , director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash ' gung ho , ' which drew over $ 36 million in u . s . box office receipts . while in many ways dated , howard ' s tongue - in - cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today . < br / > < br / > ' gung ho ' focuses on hunt stevenson ( michael keaton ) , the automakers union rep from hadleyville , a small , depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania . stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo ( similar to real - life toyota ) , which is considering a u . s . operation at the town ' s empty plant . with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse , assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line . < br / > < br / > the 112 minutes of ' gung ho ' is a humorous look at these two sides , with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered : on one hand , an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism ; on the other hand , japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self - worth . in stevenson , we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings . with the survival of his workers ' jobs and most of hadleyville on the line , stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance , although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble . besides answering to the heads of assan , we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members , many of whom he grew up with . this includes buster ( george wendt ) , willie ( john turturro ) , and paul ( clint howard , ron ' s brother ) . < br / > < br / > the japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe , also known for ' sixteen candles ' and ' volunteers . ' watanabe plays kazihiro , the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life . he is constantly shadowed by saito ( sab shimono ) , the nephew of assan ' s ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order . while given a light touch , these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culture . < br / > < br / > with hunt stevenson dominating the script , michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work . ' gung ho ' is indeed a slam - dunk success for keaton , who also teamed with ron howard in 1994 ' s ' the paper . ' he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included ' mr . mom , ' ' beetle juice , ' and ' the dream team ' before venturing into ' batman , ' ' one good cop , ' and ' my life . ' it ' s also hard not to like gedde watanabe ' s performance as the odd man out , who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit . < br / > < br / > the supporting cast is top - notch , including wendt , turturro , shimono , and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto . mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey , hunt ' s girlfriend . edwin blum , lowell ganz , and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung ho ' s solid writing . the incidental music , which received a bmi film music award , was composed by thomas newman . gung ho ' s soundtrack songs are wall - to - wall 80s , including ' don ' t get me wrong , ' ' tuff enuff , ' and ' working class man . ' < br / > < br / > the success of ' gung ho ' actually led to a short - lived tv series on abc . while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago , ron howard ' s film still has its comic value . it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short - changed . audio options are provided in english 5 . 1 surround , english dolby surround , and french ' dubbing , ' but subtitles are in english only . there are no extras , not even the theatrical trailer . on the plus side , paramount ' s digital transfer is quite good , with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound . while a few extras would have been helpful - especially that ' gung ho ' was a box office success - there ' s little to complain about the film presentation itself . < br / > < br / > * * * out of 4 
POS i absolutely loved this show . i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90 ' s to the very last episode . in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days . definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children . yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books , but it ' s still compelling with great stories and good lessons . the actress that portrays jo bhaer ( michelle burke ) does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley ( spencer rochfort ) throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn . i recommend this show to anyone . 
POS not sure why it doesn ' t play in peoria , apparently , but this is a very funny , clever british comedy . it ' s set at the end of the " swinging sixties " . peter sellars is fantastic as the rich , forty - something serial womaniser . the perfectly delectable goldie hawn , playing a 19 year american girl in london , is , initially , sellars ' " catch of the day " . but the urbane tv food critic can ' t stop himself from falling for the dizzy american blond . < br / > < br / > humour , pathos , great script , strong performances from the leads and supporting caste . < br / > < br / > it ' s a great film , and the best gag is the very last line . < br / > < br / > try it , you ' ll like it . 
POS this film never received the attention it deserved , although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting , and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen . clearly filmed on a small budget in a real v . a . hospital , the center of the story is joel , very well - played by eric stoltz . joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident , and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries . joel is in love with anna , his married lover , played by helen hunt , who shows early signs of her later academy - award winning work . < br / > < br / > although the joel - anna relationship is the basic focus , there are many other well - developed characters in the ward . wesley snipes does a tremendous job as the angry raymond . even more impressive is william forsythe as the bitter and racist bloss . i think forsythe ' s two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers , and , later , when he feels empathy for a young korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up . my favorite scene with snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post - injury sexual options . < br / > < br / > the chemistry between stoltz and hunt is very strong , and they have two very intimate , but not gratuitous , sex scenes . the orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing . there is also another memorable scene where joel and bloss and the korean boy take the specially - equipped van to the strip bar . it ' s truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the " naked ladies . " < br / > < br / > the story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director , neal jimenez , is paralyzed in real life . this is basically his story . this film is real , not glossy or flashy . to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing . i recommend this film to everyone i see , because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look . it ' s a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked , but through video , perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves . 
POS i just watched the movie i was afraid it ' s gonna disappoint me . i was rather surprised at the end though . the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times . yes , it won ' t be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones . beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had . it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did . but what the hell - it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school . beta house deserves 6 / 10 but i gave it 7 / 10 just for being another slice of pie . 
POS this movie is plain fun . i has nothing to do with the original america pie , but it is fun to watch . < br / > < br / > another try , but better than band camp and the naked mile , at least funnier . < br / > < br / > just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out , so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together . we had a few beers and we had fun . < br / > < br / > you will not find any deep message in this movie , but it ' s worth watching . < br / > < br / > so , lay back and just enjoy . 
POS there is a certain genius behind this movie . i was laughing throughout . the scene in the phone sex office , discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius / humor . execution is poor , but you can see the writer ' s message and they do have some talent . the doppelganger split at the end was like . . . " ok , wasn ' t quite expecting that but let ' s see what the movie has to say " . certainly ridiculous , but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way . < br / > < br / > is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level ? i ' m easily bored by many movies , but this one kept my interest throughout . < br / > < br / > i think the story may have some auto - biographical roots , but that ' s just a guess . horribly bad , but good . i ' m looking for other movies this person may have done ( with more experience ) . 
POS i noticed at once that this movie really wasn ' t based on dodie smith ' s novel . in any case , it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita ' s son now had his own puppies . the cutest of the dalmatians was , of course , little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film . < br / > < br / > to be honest , i didn ' t know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind . in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly , but now that she so quickly changed into " herself " again and announced that she was cruella once more , i almost began to be really worried about chloe ' s dalmatians . < br / > < br / > actually , the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner , was much better than i had expected . i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog , and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie . < br / > < br / > of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again , but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property . and what on earth could the dogs ' home do with such a huge sum of money ? < br / > < br / > finally , it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film . 
POS the plot : a crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island , that would then serve as money - laundering facility for organized crime . to thwart that , the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia lords . the thing goes wrong , and by some unlikely plot twists and turns , we are presented with another " cop buddies who don ' t like each other " movie . . . one being a female fbi agent , and the other a male ex - dea agent . < br / > < br / > so far , so stupid . but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke , at best . it is funny . ( at least the synchronized german version is ) . the action is good , too , with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher . but the focus is squarely on the humour . not intelligent satire , not quite slapstick , but somewhere in between , you get a lot of funny jokes . < br / > < br / > however , this film is the opposite of political correctness . legal drug abuse is featured prominently , without criticism , and even displaying it as cool . that ' s the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me , and renders it unsuitable for kids , in my opinion . < br / > < br / > all in all , for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes , this movie is perfect . just remember : in this genre , it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / tv room . then you ' ll have a good time . 8 / 10 
POS this is a comedy of morals , so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs , but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything . < br / > < br / > this film , marvelously written and directed , is a gem that shines perfectly , with beautiful acting by all . jean - louis trintignant is exquisite as usual , and romy schneider is a pearl , perfect and glowing , that is not to be missed . a truly wonderful film ! ! 
POS i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol . 1 collection of pure euro - trash movies . but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there . stupednous it is not . . . satisfying it is ! watching this movie i couldn ' t help to wonder . . . how come sergio martino didn ' t make this flick ? this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech ( alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii ) . double - crosses and triple - crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second . did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through ? besides lee ' s more recognizable films , film - goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone would ' ve lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time ( and 1 / 4 of the budget ) this is what it would ' ve turned out to be like . so refreshing , it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinée 
POS without being one of my favorites , this is good for being a change of pace . . . even if only for a few minutes . < br / > < br / > it all starts with a big fight between tom , jerry and spike ( who is renamed " butch " here ) . they ' re all beating each other , but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision : he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends . so , all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends . . . which isn ' t going to last for long . < br / > < br / > meanwhile , the three become affectionate , patient and kind to each other . they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life . the relationship goes nothing but excellent , until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy . the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries . < br / > < br / > but still . . . to see tom , jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience , even if only for a while . < br / > < br / > oh , by the way , as a curious fact , two songs from " the wizard of oz " are played here in instrumental versions : " we ' re off to see the wizard " and " somewhere over the rainbow " . 
POS i used to love watching this . i had no idea it was part of a larger series . i must have been 6 or so at the time it was on tv . i just thought it was funny and for some reason i had a deep fascination for something that was clear that was in the president ' s pile of bathtub toys . my parents had taped this off of tv when it originally aired on nbc . the tape even had the old sanka coffee commercial along with a few others . i ' m planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so . if anyone of you would like to contact me , i think you can do that through the imdb site feel free . i will keep you updated and let you know when i have the show in a digital format . 
POS often laugh out loud funny play on sex , family , and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it ' s seen since the days of granny and jed clampett . plot centers on two chauffers who ' ve bet on which one of them can bed his employer ( both single or soon to be single ladies , quite sexy - - bisset and woronov ) first . if manuel wins , his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang - - if he loses , he must play bottom man to his friend ! < br / > < br / > lots of raunchy dialogue , fairly sick physical humour , etc . but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface . bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy , teenaged niece on a year long " missionary trip " to africa . < br / > < br / > hilarious fun . 
POS this is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots . the philippines substitute for thailand and nobody actually goes to hong kong . the stock shot of a cathay pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly . this film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie . it contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into . solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office . an excellent piece of work ! 
POS " what would you do ? " is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional brokedown palace . you will also be left wondering if alice ( danes ) was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved , and rightly so . this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film . although it is slow at times , its pace is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat ; wanting to know what happens next . the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters , which are brilliantly played by kate beckinsale and claire danes . bill pullman ' s performance is commendable , too . 
POS excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances . it ' s often cited as his best , and i can ' t really judge fully until i have seen his " dawn patrol " . however , his work in " they died with their boots on " takes some beating . i ' m a big flynn fan ( he ' s my favourite actor after james mason - - it also helps that he ' s an aussie ) and i think he ' s just marvellous , a great screen presence and also a great actor . he is the centrepiece of " gentleman jim " as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork , but he is also backed up by a literate , warm and funny script , and raoul walsh ' s direction . every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it ' s pace , he truly was a born film - maker . walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully , as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant , great final scene between ward bord and flynn . add to that great production values ( the " gay nineties " never looked better ! ) and a lovely supporting cast and it ' s pretty much perfect entertainment . alan hale usually played flynn ' s sidekick , but here is his father , and it still all works . alexis smith is flynn ' s love interest . the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other . 
POS interesting characters , lots of tension . as close to black and white without being black and white . i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character , a quiet , near deaf secretary , was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues , rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist , and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get - away . i ' m a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they ' ve done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks . in this film we never know who ' s money it really is they abscond with , or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf - secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot . too bad , the film could have been great . 
POS after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty - seven times , there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama , " read my lips " . having written over five hundred reviews , i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard ' s subtle , yet inspirational love story . thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film , and while the " loves " overpowered , it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind . " read my lips " is a drama . to be more precise , is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work . here is where this review begins to crumble , it is all of these items  but it is more much , much more . as a viewer , you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos ' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla , whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty . audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid , causing an immediate unrest , not only from the characters within the film , but to those watching . without sound , the world is left open to any possibility , and that is frightening . < br / > < br / > as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life , we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul ( played exquisitely by vincent cassel ) , a slicked - back hair , mustache - wearing lanky man who was just released from prison , homeless , jobless , and forced by his parole officer to get a job . this is how carla and paul meet . there is that moment of instant , unsettling attraction . the one where we think she loves him , but he is dark ( and here is where it gets even more fun )  and where we think he loves her , but she is dark . the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown . who , as viewers , are we to feel the most sympathy for ? paul sleeps in the office , carla helps him ; carla looses a contract to a rival co - worker , paul helps her ; carla ' s ability to read people ' s lips comes in handy for a make - shift idea for paul . the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair , waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave . it never does . audiard cannot just allow this story to take place , he continually introduces us to more characters ; one just as seedy as the next . even our rock , our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me , but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film . yet none of this could have happened if it weren ' t for our characters . devos ' solemn and homely look is breathtaking , as she changes her image for paul ; the truth of her beauty is discovered . paul , the wildcard in the film , continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame . then , just as we assume one , carla takes on one last shape . < br / > < br / > audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters . cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair . the story , probably the weakest part of this film , is at first random . the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first , but audiard lets them connect bit by bit . again , the entire parole officer segment was tangent , but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means . not attempting to sound vague , but this complex ( yet utterly simple ) story is difficult to explain . there is plenty happening , but it is up to you to connect the pieces . a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held . that use of sound and scene was brilliant . it was tense , it was dramatic , and it was like watching a who - dun - it mystery unfold before your eyes . < br / > < br / > overall , i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong . " read my lips " opens the floor for discussion , not just with the characters , but the situations . one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene , and paul in the next . when a discovery is made in paul ' s apartment by carla , i found myself deeply angry . audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development , and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry . i can easily suggest this film to anyone , but be prepared ; this isn ' t a one time viewing film . repeat . repeat . repeat . < br / > < br / > grade : * * * * out of * * * * * 
POS a patchwork about 911 . the 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic , sometimes boring ( the first one , for example ) , sometimes used to say to americans " we have had more deaths than you , and you supported the murderers " , sometimes really weird ( but highly symbolic and interesting ) . i really loved the claude lelouch ( personal live of a couple in new - york , showing that our day - to - day " problems " are unimportant ) , shoei imamura ( bizarre , strongly anti - wars in general ) , and idrissa ouedraogo ( funny , typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery ) , and youssef chahine ( an egyptian intellectual , pro - peace , having moral difficulties to accept the u . s . policy towards arab countries ) i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie . it shows that we ( or they ? i am still belgian , but living in texas for 12 years ) are still interested by other cultures , and able to question past and present actions of our government , like we should in a democracy . 
POS this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september 11th attacks . this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u . s . soil . the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives . i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point . it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks . and some of the pieces are actually funny , but not abusively so . this film came highly recommended to me , and i pass on the same feeling . 
POS though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience . there were some who , in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings , took this to be anti - american . i don ' t think thats the case , even though some parts might be taken that way if you don ' t look behind the obvious . ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion , sympathy and feelings about what happened . these are stories of people who ' s worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a tuesday in september . < br / > < br / > as i said this film will move you , probably to tears . its not always easy to watch , for example the film from mexico is little more than a black screen with sound , but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low . if you can be strong you really should see this film . it will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you . . . 
POS i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery . while i knew it was only a " b " film , a space western , i loved it . it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non - the - less held my imagination and provided great escapism . sadly our society has so much available , discounting small attempts is too easy . in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare , i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake . i am a cop and found affinity with the retired lapd . dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another ' s life ( or my own ) . while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy ( predictable ) i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph . my world is really too cynical . 
POS good film . tells a boyish fantasy story , telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . or at least the feeling : that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . if you wanted to express love for someone you don ' t know , how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ? also it ' s about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life , of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats . what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . do we have to listen to the nrj shouting , see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ? 
POS a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is . the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels . it isn ' t supposed to but it does . this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer . it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema . obviously , 1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed . one can listen to rock and roll music , one of the songs played is the song " hey babu riba " ala the title of the movie . but jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess . unlike a heavy - handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four . the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him , the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys , the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it . the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands . these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away , as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire . a great movie worth seeing again and again . " repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody ' s friend . " 
POS john singleton ' s finest film , before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake , this is a thought - provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters , each with identifiable youngster problems . < br / > < br / > what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks , a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social - economical problems and racism by whites . this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist . < br / > < br / > the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow . it ' s not just about racism , but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world ( college ) , date rape , discovering sexuality and isolation . omar epps , michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances , and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez ( yay ) and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riots . < br / > < br / > the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne ( " peppermint ? " ) . surely , plenty of professors are nutty . but they ' re not as flat . the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature , but i guess they are like that too in real life . < br / > < br / > overall a great underrated piece of filmwork , if you liked american history x you ' ll love this one . < br / > < br / > 8 , 5 out of 10 
POS well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my # 1 favorite actress after seeing her in " the ' 60s " and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history ! ! ! ! 
POS absolutely the very first film that scared me to death . i happened catch it when my older brother ( r . i . p . ) was watching it . it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested . shortly after , my folks bought a color set and , as luck would have it , the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday . < br / > < br / > i had forgotten most of the plot , but it did not take long to catch up . . . and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night ! i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space , but you could not hear it , or see it . . . and once it got hold of you it was too late . even now , after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine . a true classic , and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation ! < br / > < br / > long live the blob ! 
POS this , " prodigal son " and " eastern condors " are my favourite sammo hung films . the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in " condors " , but he ' s no less sure - footed as director or actor . he is , in fact , at the top of his form and delivers a devastating , brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate , sweet love story also . love and romance are not the director ' s priorities here , but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action , and insure that viewers don ' t hit the fast - forward button between the physical clashes . < br / > < br / > the opening scene , which features a funny light sabre duel , sets a solid but deceptive tone . a sequence in which sammo ' s pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp , comic tone . the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp , superb direction , and easily one of the best ever of its type . the film ' s violence escalates slowly until , finally , when the climactic showdown comes , we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production . the director / actor ' s assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry , menacing opponents is a bone - cracking , physically punishing delight . < br / > < br / > terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made . < br / > < br / > great score , too . 
POS bell , book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid - twentieth century , very similar to the phenoms we see today ( back in the 70 ' s - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film ) . it made novak a huge star , put a nice item on jack lemon ' s resume , cast new light on jimmy stewart , and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers ( both went on to continue to play witches and other curious " old bats " , in film and television ) . < br / > < br / > along with the 40s movie i married a witch ( which helped to make veronica lake an icon ) , bell , book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic , worst witch and harry potter . < br / > < br / > what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie . the story takes place over the christmas holidays , and , despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft , actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit ( giving , love , family , self - sacrifice , etc ) . < br / > < br / > i will always watch this movie ( have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90 ' s ) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season . it has style , substance , a great cast , and terrific production values . and like adam ' s rib , it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time , are radical even now ( in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful ) , and so always seems ahead of the times . 
POS generally , i am not a huge fan of stop - motion films and at first ruka didn ' t capture my attention . however , knowing that this film was made in the repressive czechoslovakia during the soviet - domination era , the more i watched the film , the more i realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was . this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement . < br / > < br / > the sad little film is done without any dialog , but it ' s pretty clear what is happening . a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot - - making it into a sculpture of a hand instead . well , the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing . however , over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man . and , by the end , the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand , in a sign of real hypocrisy , gives the man a hero ' s funeral ! < br / > < br / > as i said , this film is an obvious attempt by the brave jirí trnka to criticize his domineering government . not surprisingly , though czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise , the state ( i . e . , the hand ) banned this little parable . sadly , trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co - called " velvet revolution " . 
POS to suggest anton newcombe of the brian jonestown massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly . in dig ! which won the grand jury prize at sundance , we watch him and his band self - sabotage over seven years , while ex - friends and contemporaries the dandy warhols rise to comparative greatness ( a mobile phone advert , anyway ) . < br / > < br / > what elevates dig ! above its contemporaries is the immense , near - biblical comic - tragedy being played out : a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise . for all his " look at me , i ' m a bloody genius " posturing , newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted , if immensely troubled , musician - far more talented than his rival , the dandy ' s courtney taylor who narrates the picture . if newcombe is dennis hopper , taylor ' s peter fonda . < br / > < br / > even sadder , taylor appears to realise this , evinced by his weary , self - loathing voice - over : he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost ? in truth , they sold out , made indie - lite records , kept their teeth nice and clean , and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus . and jettisoning all credibility in the process . newcombe , on the other hand , lives in filth , is continually busted , beats up fellow band members on stage , kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in dig ! being ferried away by police , having lost the right to see his child . < br / > < br / > two of the best films about rock ' s subculture have been directed by women : penelope spheeris ' s the decline of western civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released . 
POS i thought this movie was really really great ! helena did an amazing job in it ! i thought she played her character very well ! she ' s an awesome actress ! ! : ) < br / > < br / > the movie was also really funny too ! the jokes were great ! i couldnt stop laughing ! : ) < br / > < br / > i think everyone should see it . . . : ) < br / > < br / > 
POS < br / > < br / > i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same . mainly because of my feelings at the end . i and all the people around me were simply touched . this is something you don ' t often feel . we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality , lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films . the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard , a man on the verge of a breakdown . this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous , humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie . < br / > < br / > the acting from branagh and bonham - carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role . the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie . < br / > < br / > the title comes from richards masterpiece , a plane made of junk and his old paintings . flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end . < br / > < br / > a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone . don ' t let the subject matter put you off . 
POS a simple and effective film about what life is all about , responding to challenges . it took a lot of gall for homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son , to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate . it took also three different challenges for homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future . the challenge of the first ever man - made artificial satellite , sputnik 1 , a soviet satellite , a milestone in human history , a turning point that homer and his friends could not miss , did not want to miss . then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds . finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack , even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity , and even then homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams . but there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough . homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need . if he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship , because his friends gave him precedence , his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate , thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes . it is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road . but the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man , like mining or football . the working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father . if the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day , the working class fate i am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap . here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think . this might have been the fourth challenge homer had to face : the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father . < br / > < br / > dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine & university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne 
POS let ' s keep it simple : my two kids were glued to this movie . it has its flaws from an adult perspective , but buy some jelly - worms and just enjoy it . < br / > < br / > and the pepsi girl was excellent ! < br / > < br / > and kimberly williams was pretty gosh - darned hot , although she ' s not in the film very much , so don ' t get too excited there . < br / > < br / > not that ' s it ' s really a bad thing , but it is the kind of movie you watch just once . don ' t buy the dvd . < br / > < br / > enjoy ! < br / > < br / > did i mention kimberly williams ? ( that was for the dads . ) 
POS my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film . it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood , but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenberg ' s refrain , " boys are so weird . " it ' s refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup . boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly ! we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend , myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out . we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it . it ' s clean and delightfully acted by a pre - adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic " freaks and geeks " . we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the " freaks & geeks " which didn ' t survive its first season but sold - out its dvd release . do see it especially if you have boys and you ' ll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety ! girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say , " boys are so weird ! " don ' t miss it . . . 
POS generally speaking , the plot was much better than i was expecting . the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way ; however , there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it . my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers . spade , in particular , was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions , but his character comes across quite well in the pilot . there is is enough eye - candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them . now , if the writers can just live up to what they have begun . 
POS " hollywood hotel " is a fast - moving , exuberant , wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked . it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown - - " hooray for hollywood . " the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems , however , including the charming " i ' m like a fish out of water , " and " silhouetted in the moonlight . " the best musical number is " let that be a lesson to you , " in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves " behind the eight - ball , " a fate which literally befalls slow - burning edgar kennedy at the number ' s end . the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once , as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego - maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives . the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians - - allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent , ted healy as dick powell ' s would - be manager , fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron , glenda farrell as mona marshall ' s sarcastic gal friday , edgar kennedy as a put - upon drive - in manager , mabel todd as mona ' s goofy sister , and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad . the " racist " element mentioned in another review here is a ten - second bit where herbert appears in black - face during a pseudo - " gone with the wind " sequence . it ' s in questionable taste , but it shouldn ' t prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film , notably the benny goodman quartet ( including teddy wilson and lionel hampton ! ) in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo . the " dark eyes " sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late , but otherwise " hollywood hotel " is a gem , well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release . 
POS a pure reality bytes film . fragile , beautiful and amazing first film of the director . represented spain on the berlinale 2002 . some people has compared the grammar of the film with almodovar ' s films . . . well , that shouldn ' t be a problem . . . 
POS the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it . but it is so subtle you don ' t know how to read it ! are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on . the little dialogue the film has isn ' t very delicate and this adds to the power of the film . if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn ' t take anything away from the film . the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story . < br / > < br / > i is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame . i first say this film as part of a " black " film festival . after watching the film i was so impressed by the work . but then i asked myself what next ? where can someone else see this work ? the common association of art without purpose isn ' t to be found here . you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish . the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason . the character development is amazing . the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film ; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film . < br / > < br / > we need to see more of these kinds of films , there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board . 
POS this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored . prince ' s oscar for music was richly deserved ( many people don ' t know he won one ) . i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd . a great surprise : prince does a fine job acting , and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera . morris day , wendy , and lisa are good in their supporting roles . very cool landmark film . 
POS our imp of the perverse did good his first time out , thats for sure . the music is the best you may ever hear by any human , but you already know that , unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness . a poor script that doesn ' t flesh out much of a story , but at least it has its moments . the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it . he deserved an oscar for this s * * t , even though he was at times an ego driven twit , with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front . a movie that made non - fans fans , take it or leave it . prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though . he takes himself way to serious . he is a genius musician , but pleaseee . . just enjoy the ride , my purple maestro . . peace . 
POS what great locations . a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens . this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days . good going folks ! . i can not wait to see what your next feature will be . i ' ll be with you all the way . 
POS when my now college age daughter was in preschool , this miniseries appeared on a & e from 8 - 9 each morning . my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldn ' t miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week . good choice . < br / > < br / > i ' d forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently . timothy dalton is very handsome , but still perfect as rochester . the dark , craggy face , the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book . although dalton eats a little scenery , i couldn ' t sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds . the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance . < br / > < br / > i would love to know what ' s become of zelah clarke . she is dead on as jane , quiet , formal , saying volumes with but a look . the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth . criticism of her performance as " wooden " is misplaced . a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor , but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion . unlike many other screen janes , she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochester ' s attraction to her . < br / > < br / > bronte ' s dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact . dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity . although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard , she refuses to be cowed by the dark , blustery rochester . the two leads play off each other beautifully . < br / > < br / > this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever . 
POS i really have to say , this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma . and it still is . it is very , very close to the book . the way it is filmed , and the players were just all excellent ! i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn ' t seen it . almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies , but this was really great ! i gave it 10 / 10 . 
POS this wonderful 1983 bbc television production ( not a movie , as others have written here ) of the classic love story " jane eyre " , starring timothy dalton as rochester , and zelah clarke as jane , is the finest version that has been made to date , since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue . < br / > < br / > a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ; when film producers start to meddle with a classic ' s very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed . thankfully the producers of this " jane eyre " approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original , which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times , to enjoy its multi - layers of sweetness and delight and suspense . the performances are delightful , the music is just right , even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful , and set the right tone for the production . < br / > < br / > my only criticism , though slight , is that this version , like every other version ever made of jane eyre , ignores the christian influences that built jane ' s character and influenced her moral choices . in today ' s modern world a woman in jane ' s situation wouldn ' t think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her . " oh , just get a divorce " , she would say to her man , or she would live in sin with him . but jane eyre knew she couldn ' t settle for this course in life and respect herself . why ? this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood , not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution , but from the christian example of a true friend , helen burns , who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek . someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation . a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing " even so , come lord jesus ! " should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it . 
POS one must admit , that dev has an eye for beauty and talent . he gave a break to zeenat aman , a successful model , and also former winner of beauty pageant ' s title , by casting her in a role , which was tailor - made for her debut . her bespectacled , stoned look , and her swaying at the hypnotizing music , made her an instant darling of the viewers . this movie is a treat to the eyes , with it ' s scenic locales , ethnic people , those buddha temples , and chirpy , naughty mumtaz , who looks quite attractive , in her ethnic wear , and dancing skills . dev is of course , adorable , and this is one of his commercially successful performance . hare rama manages to keep the interest going , with it ' s carefully written script , editing , and captivating music . like des pardes , his another movie , anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction , and the theory of them coming from disturbed families , and troubled childhood , is quite plausible . a good entertainer , this movie retains it ' s freshness till date ! 
POS don ' t listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film . . . . . simply put , as regards ninja movies , this my friends is about as good as it gets ! < br / > < br / > yes it ' s silly , yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious , but by gum - it ' s so much bloody fun ! in fact , as is often the case with b - movies , the horrendous ' acting ' ( which in the case of the movie in question , is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold ! ) and ridiculous ' plot ' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold . < br / > < br / > obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i ' m pleased to say , they ' re very well choreographed , especially the final showdown ( during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity . . . . ) < br / > < br / > trust me on this , if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen sakura killers , then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion , one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre . 
POS hold your man finds jean harlow , working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble . the film starts out as his film , but by the time it ' s over the emphasis definitely switches to her character . < br / > < br / > the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner , garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops . as he ' s being chased gable ducks into harlow ' s apartment and being he ' s such a charming fellow , she shields him . < br / > < br / > before long she ' s involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets . gable , harlow , and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst , but then gable won ' t go through with it . of course when hurst realizes it was a con , he ' s still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out . but then he winds up dead outside harlow ' s apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify . she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter . < br / > < br / > the rest of the film is her ' s and her adjustment to prison life . her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes . i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged . < br / > < br / > harlow also gets to do the title song and it ' s done as torch style ballad , very popular back in those days . she talk / sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well . < br / > < br / > gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience , a part he ' d play often , most notably in my favorite gable film , honky tonk . < br / > < br / > still it ' s harlow who gets to shine in this film . i think it ' s one of the best she did at mgm , her fans should not miss it . 
POS offside is the story of teenage - girls who tried to sneak in the stadium to watch final world cup qualifying soccer match in tehran that may lead iran to the 2006 world cup in germany . females are forbidden to go to stadium by law in iran , although many of them dress like boys and sneak in . stadium guards search every one at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and of course ; no girl gets in . < br / > < br / > like most of panahi ' s work , his armature cast ' s performance was superb . you actually think that you are watching a documentary . the dialogs between the girls and the privates were executed delicately and astonishingly believable . the film depicts the interactions between captives and the drafted guards who themselves are serving mandartory away from their family and friends in a funny sort of way . at the end , the audience realizes that there is not such a difference between the girls and the guards who were just following orders . 
POS this was the first of panahi ' s films that i have seen , i saw it at melbourne film festival . i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly . i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this , they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown . there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture , but i found the more subtle differences between the characters , that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen , extremely fascinating . there are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me , so unique . i found it made the characters compelling viewing . 
POS the us state dept . would not like us to see this movie , because they have a beef with the iranian govt . however , it shows us just how civilized iran really is , despite the content of the film , which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms : the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium , which is strictly limited to male audiences alone . the film is hilariously funny , and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran . i enjoyed this movie intensely . five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and bahrain . the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe , from the bus trip to the stadium , to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls , to the resulting end . don ' t miss this classic film . its a must see . one of the best foreign films i ' ve seen in years . 
POS " cinema is dead , long live the cinema ! " said peter greenaway , one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors , at the last year ' s romanian film festival anonimul , which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta . this year the direction prize went to jafar panahi ' s " offside " . i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festival ' s retrospective . cinema is dead but still very lively . panahi ' s film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks . digitally filmed , " offside " is a story inspired by a real - life event happened to panahi ' s daughter : the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match . this is forbidden in iran as we are informed . what panahi manages to do is to render with few means , but with , probably , a lot of work , intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level . the absurdity of the laws becomes comical . the film has a happy end , after all because iran ' s team goes to the world cup . what i appreciated most was the concept , the idea behind this film . i would be very interested to see panahi ' s other films that were forbidden in iran as well . i guess that he can be thought as an activist director . 
POS in iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be " corrupted " by bad language , close proximity to thousands of men , and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums . based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director , jafar panahi ' s offside follows six girls , disguised as men , who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between iran and bahrain , a match that will decide whether or not iran goes to the world cup . in a departure from the bleak , minimalist films we have been accustomed to from iran over the last ten years , offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in iran . < br / > < br / > shot with a digital camera using non - professional actors who are more than up to the task , the girls try to sneak into azadi stadium in tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium . they are guarded by three young army conscripts ( safdar samandar , mohammed kheir - abadi , and masoud kheymeh - kaboud ) who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules . the women are soccer enthusiasts , not political activists and cheer for iran ' s victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the vice squad and an uncertain future . < br / > < br / > outspoken rather than acting like victims , they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions , making their absurdity quite obvious . although they can hear the crowd noise , the women cannot see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game . one of the funniest sequences takes place when a female " prisoner " is escorted to the men ' s room by a soldier . the young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside . < br / > < br / > little by little , to paraphrase adlai stevenson , that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send iran to the world cup . although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle , offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens . one can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century . 
POS this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time . the dialogue , with the constant use of puns is very tight , the cast are superb , and the plot is highly original . < br / > < br / > don ' t take my word for it - watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself . 
POS let me say that i love adam sandler , watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting < br / > < br / > when he raises his voice , i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball , then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in < br / > < br / > reign over me is a great film , a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene < br / > < br / > don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does < br / > < br / > adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic / best acted film of his career . but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film < br / > < br / > the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith < br / > < br / > i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is 
POS as someone who has never condescended adam sandler in terms of talent , as is done to him and many comic actors like him , i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film , not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall . even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it . he will make you weep , especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue . what ' s amazing about his role is that it ' s a character it ' s hard to say we ' ve seen before . we ' ve seen many emotionally scarred characters , many mentally retarded people , many loners , many passionate self - centered artists , but sandler ' s charlie fineman is none of these . he may have a taste of each of them in some ways , but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual . it ' s a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems , mindset , and provocations are completely different from most characters like him . < br / > < br / > don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level . he is every man . he is the most normal possible person in the world , so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either , or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson , whose name is even found on the assembly line . cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny , jolting , smart , and stupid the way so many normal people are . < br / > < br / > the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who ' ve hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles . jada pinkett - smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife , donald sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge , robert klein is sandler ' s desensitized father - in - law . < br / > < br / > mike binder ' s script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises . it ' s much more subtle than , say , babel , and has a much more close - to - home ideal . < br / > < br / > the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style . this film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen - sink style of the 1970s . cinematography was grainy and unfastened , but that was its charm . it wasn ' t about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would ' ve diluted its stories with such . < br / > < br / > the music , which plays a major role in the film , and its title , is very powerful . near the beginning , you feel like you ' re in for another about schmidt or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack , but you soon realize you ' re in for more than that . in fact , the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes . < br / > < br / > reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself . it goes to show that even the director of blankman is capable of wonders . 
POS there may be spoilers ! < br / > < br / > charlie fineman ( adam sandler ) , who lost his family in a tragedy , ( the terrorist attacks of sept . 11 ) , still grieves over their deaths . he runs into his former college roommate , alan johnson ( don cheadle ) , and the two rekindle their friendship . alan vows to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss . this is a simplification of the basic story of reign over me . < br / > < br / > this movie is , however , a story of how fate intercedes in our lives when we ourselves may be powerless do any thing about our own states of being . alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling . he feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality . he is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work . he can ' t express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world . he chances upon charlie on the streets of manhattan while driving from his job . eventually he meets and discovers that charlie , ( who originally does not remember alan ) , is living in a false reality of his own . charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family . he lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band , collecting vinyl records of the 60s and 70s bands , and playing video games . he has escaped to a better and safer time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose . everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected charlie and his remission to a formerly different and better ( ? ) place . his landlady is his protector and great enabler . his in - laws are subtracted from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life . and alan is most affected by him because alan wants to , ( in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality ) to be with charlie as a means to subtract himself from his own stifled reality and then he wants to find a way to help charlie begin to recover from his self - induced guilt and denial of loss . it is through this relationship that not only is charlie able to begin to heal himself but that alan , in fact , learns to communicate and sate his true desires with his associates at work and , eventually , is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her . it is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and alan are talking about the situation together over " chinese " that charlie states that he is in fact worried about alan and not himself . < br / > < br / > this movie will , if you let it , take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking . it will have you laughing at how charlie uses his words , like people really do in everyday life , to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation . it will leave you on the verge of tears , ( in my case actual tears ) , when charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss . and that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew : denial . it will make you curse at the cold , unthinking actions of a young prosecutor trying to win his " case " , ( as i actually did at charlie ' s hearing ! ) and it will make you smile at the commonsense of a old and wise , stern judge , ( donald sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise , stern person in the legal profession since wilford brimley played an assistant attorney general in absence of malice . ) < br / > < br / > this movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons : ( 1 ) i never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film . which means it had me from the beginning to the end , ( 2 ) although the cast was interracial , this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film . race was a non - factor to the performance of the roles in this movie . amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out ! and ( 3 ) the only real reference to 9 / 11 is when charlie ' s financial attorney refers to the tragedy of charlie ' s loss as " what charlie had become on 9 / 12 " . time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then reign over me succeeded phenomenally as far as i am concerned . i have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and i will wait impatiently for the day i can purchase it as a dvd . 
POS greetings again from the darkness . how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain . adam sandler stars as charlie , a man who lost his family in the 9 / 11 tragedy , and has since lost his career , his reason to live and arguably , his sanity . don cheadle co - stars as sandler ' s former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life ( that sandler apparently had prior to 9 / 11 ) . < br / > < br / > of course the parallels in these men ' s lives are obvious , but it is actually refreshing to see men ' s feelings on display in a movie . . . feelings other than lust and revenge , that is . watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt . writer / director mike binder ( " the upside of anger " , and sandler ' s accountant in this film ) really brings a different look and feel to the film . some of the scenes don ' t work as well as others , but overall it is well written and solidly directed . < br / > < br / > sandler and cheadle are both excellent . sandler ' s character reminds a bit of his fine performance in " punch drunk love " , but here he brings much more depth . cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries . . . just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle . < br / > < br / > support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith ( as cheadle ' s wife ) , liv tyler ( as a very patient psychiatrist ) , saffron burrows ( in an oddly appealing role ) , donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler ' s in - laws . < br / > < br / > the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined . in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc , you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde , bruce springsteen and roger daltrey . . . as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey . not exactly a chipper upbeat film , but it is a quality film with an unusual story . 
POS i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it , i wondered if it was an independent film , and i was correct , but with a good cast i decided to chance it . basically drifter michael williams ( nicolas cage ) is in the town red rock , wyoming , looking for a job , and meeting bar owner wayne brown ( pleasantville ' s j . t . walsh ) he is given a large sum of money , mistaken for a hit - man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne ( lara flynn boyle ) . he does not correct him , takes the money , and goes to warn suzanne , and after she makes him a counteroffer , he decides he needs to leave . when wayne knows his real identity , he chases michael shooting a big gun , until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas ( dennis hopper ) . but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit - man he was mistaken for , and he makes a quick retreat . he goes back to suzanne , and knowing they are both in danger , they plan to leave town together , and add another complication by falling for each other . before they leave however , suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe . of course things aren ' t going to go smoothly , and wayne and lyle catch up to them , and lyle forces them and now tied - up wayne to go and get the buried money . in the end , lyle and wayne both get what they deserve , michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together , but it is obvious she cares more about the money , and she gets what she deserves too . also starring craig reay as jim , vance johnson as mr . johnson , timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack , dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard . the performances , apart from maybe a lame boyle , are all fine and dandy , and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller . very good ! 
POS an excellent example of " cowboy noir " , as it ' s been called , in which unemployed michael ( nicolas cage ) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest ( he ' s got a bum leg ) . with really nothing else he can do , he decides that for once he ' s going to lie . when he walks into a bar , and the owner wayne ( the late , great j . t . walsh ) mistakes him for a hit - man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne ( lara flynn boyle in fine form ) , michael plays along and accepts waynes ' money . * then * he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands ' intentions , and accepts * her * money to get rid of wayne ! if that didn ' t complicate things enough , the real hit - man , " lyle from dallas " ( dennis hopper , in a perfect role for him ) shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before . < br / > < br / > " red rock west " gets a lot out of the locations . director john dahl , who co - wrote the script with his brother rick , was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes . it ' s also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation . it ' s an appreciably dark and twist - laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt , have at least been morally compromised like michael . the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing . even if the writing isn ' t particularly " logical or credible " , the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in . < br / > < br / > cage does a good job in the lead , but his co - stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed - motivated characters . hopper , boyle , and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts . timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs ' deputies ( in one especially good twist , walsh is also the local sheriff ) , and there ' s an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam , who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune . < br / > < br / > it ' s quite a good little film worth checking out . it moves forward at an impressive pace , and if nothing else is certainly never boring . < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 
POS red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget . all you need is a smart script , good actors and loads of atmosphere . rrw delivers all these and more . < br / > < br / > nic cage plays an ex - marine , injured in lebanon , who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee . he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne ( jt walsh , not quite as his most menacing - but still evil ) for a hit - man from texas . < br / > < br / > he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary . only when he gets there , just to check her out . she offers him double to kill wayne . cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be . but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo - yoing in and out of red rock , back and forth . eventually this leads to a run - in with lyle from dallas ( a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper ) , the real hit - man from texas who offers to help without knowing he ' s making the plot more complicated . < br / > < br / > rrw never had a big release , thus most of it ' s audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings . viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it ' s bigger than that . the slick , slowly - timed direction , moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv . < br / > < br / > the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle ' s boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke - ish hairdo . i certainly wouldn ' t fall for her but if you assume that nic cage ' s character is in to militant lesbians then you ' ll accept it nonetheless . 
POS this is one of the funniest series ever ! i laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor . if only someone would release in america . region 0 or 1 - non - pal please . < br / > < br / > i know it being released in the uk but that ' s region 2 and pal besides ! let ' s give this series its fair shake . america must know this series . moffat is a genius . i loved tracie bennett ' s quirky , goofy role in this . of course i liked fiona gillies ! but tracie was a treasure ! < br / > < br / > release this show in america ! or show it again on the pbs stations . i need to laugh and laugh again ! please indulge us , please ! please ! < br / > < br / > thanks for reading . 
POS one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta . the idea of living the chulawasse river before it ' s turned into a lake comes from burt reynold ' s lewis , who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare . but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie , the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story , with our men forced to make a decision that ( they know ) will change their lives forever . in very bad ways . at the end of the movie , each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week - end on the river but muted into a fight for survival . the movie ( except some pretty evident goofs ) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath . the photography is excellent as well . voight , reynolds , cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake . 
POS " deliverance " is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970 ' s decade from whence so many other exploitation films came . < br / > < br / > a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives . it ' s awesome . < br / > < br / > we are treated to anal rape , vicious beatings , bow and arrow killings , shootings , broken bones , etc . . . a lot like 1974 ' s " texas chainsaw massacre , " to say that " deliverance " is believable would be immature . this would never and could never happen , even in the dark ages of 1972 . < br / > < br / > " deliverance " is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action . it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70 ' s and it ( arguably ) sits on top of that pile with it ' s great acting , superb cinematography and excellent writing . < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10 , kids . 
POS the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters , as they suffered through this horrible ordeal . the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors , playing parts . i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one . burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen , as well as fine performances by ned beatty , ronny cox , bill mckinney , and though he appeared only briefly , james dickey , the man who authored the book upon which the film is based , as the sheriff of aintry . it is somewhat disturbing , and kids , of course , should be shielded from it , but this is great , dramatic cinema . 
POS i watch romantic comedies with some hesitation , for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting . typically in a romantic comedy , there is a girl and there is a guy , both fall in love , then have troubles , and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever . but , this movie is a different story , it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately . < br / > < br / > there is a widowed guy ( dan ) , there is a girl ( marie ) . dan meets marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime , after sometime marie has to leave . dan develops something for her , and when this something starts to turn meaningful , we get a twist . marie is the girlfriend of his brother . unheeded of the circumstances , dan flirts with marie and realizes that he loves her , and even marie loves him , but their love would not just be possible . how it is made possible forms the rest of the story . < br / > < br / > steve carell performs well , juliette binoche is good as marie . and every other stuff is done well . it is a good movie , watch it . 
POS first time i saw this movie was in the eighties , but reviewed now this thriller is still actual . some newer movies focus on similar topics , but they do not match this french milestone . < br / > < br / > a president - obviously jf kennedy - gets shot in an open car during a public appearance . the resulting huge investigation finds the " lee harvey oswald " figure of this movie guilty , but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry . he reveals some surprising evidence . . . < br / > < br / > unlike oliver stone ' s jfk - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions , but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together , drawing a new picture of the assassination . even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene . compared to jfk this movie is more reasonable , intelligent and thrilling . parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies , i had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema . < br / > < br / > " i . . . comme icare " is a " must see " . its unique and brilliant , and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful . this movie deserves a very good ranking , if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure . < br / > < br / > 
POS superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80 ' s exploitation , hooray ! the pre - credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we ' re dealing with a serious and harrowing drama , but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we ' re up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles , rough fist - fights , lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity ! bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship . can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister ' s naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes ? well , bo does that to his sister and , judging by her dubbed laughter , she doesn ' t mind at all . sick , dude ! anyway , as kids they fled from russia with their parents , but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy . a friendly smuggler took custody over them , however , and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers . when the actual plot lifts off , 20 years later , they ' re facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine . very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of " white fire " , but it sure is a lot of fun to watch . most of the time you have no clue who ' s beating up who or for what cause ( and i bet the actors understood even less ) but whatever ! the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded . the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i won ' t reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes . bo ' s principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent , the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film , there ' s the obligatory " we ' re - falling - in - love " montage and loads of other attractions ! my god , what a brilliant experience . the original french title translates itself as " life to survive " , which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie : none ! 
POS i had seen this movie when it got released , and when i was 12 years old : ) and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escape every time when faced with danger : ) and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain ! i think many so - called action movies copied a lot many " escape scenes " from this movie ! ! and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying , it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece ! : ) the lead actors have acted wonderfully . the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b / w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed . as children , we felt that the love that developed b / w them was very natural : ) the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love , sacrifice and caring . i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance ! ! - - vijay . 
POS yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222 @ verizon . net . i searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close . 
POS a bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of great depression . it tells us about another notorious hit - man , michael ( mike ) salliwan . somehow , this time the story turns the other way round : mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son , because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss . he succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son , but gets killed in the end . such stories never have happy end after all . < br / > < br / > the role of mike salliwan senior was wonderfully played by tom hanks , and the part of mr . rooney ( the mafia boss ) was performed by paul newman . the film makes a great impression , and we hear the well - known phrase " we rob banks " . this film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from sam mendes after his american beauty . 
POS tom hanks like you ' ve never seen him before . hanks plays michael sullivan , " the angel of death " . he is a hitman for his surrogate father john rooney ( paul newman ) an elderly irish mob boss . sullivan ' s young son ( tyler hoechlin ) witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of sullivan ' s wife and other son . enter jude law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters . filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30 ' s . sometimes the pace bogs down , but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story . director sam mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty , responsibility , betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son . other notable cast members are : dylan baker , stanley tucci , daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh . hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie . make room for some oscars ! 
POS i loved this film ! i ' m a true tom hanks fan , and i have always been impressed with all of his work . from his most dramatic roles like cast away , the green mile , saving private ryan , forrest gump , apollo 13 & philadelphia . to his hilarious roles like a league of their own , turner and hooch , catch me if you can , the lady killers , big & of course toy story . but in this film hanks isn ' t the only great actor who lights up the screen . tyler hoechlin , an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance . he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career , i believe he will do great things . paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen . he is truly a legend . we can ' t forget the people who didn ' t have such big roles in the film , but still helped make it great . the beautiful & very talented jennifer jason leigh , who ' s performance in bastard out of carolina & single white female i will never forget , brings her grace to the screen as hank ' s wife in the film and does a superb job . liam aiken is another found treasure in film . he does such a great job with such a small role , and like his roles in lemony snickets , and sweet november , and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance . 
POS after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex - rental dvds , i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes ? for a number of reasons , " american beauty " doesn ' t appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks ' name on it ( still can ' t watch " big " without wanting a cat to kick ) , i ' m glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you ' ll kick yourself for if you miss it . < br / > < br / > normally squeaky - clean hanks plays michael sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early 1930 ' s . he is also a professional hit - man to mob boss john rooney ( paul newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . but after his eldest ( tyler hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up . soon , father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit - man ( a menacing jude law ) is waiting for them . < br / > < br / > on the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i ' ve said , this isn ' t really about gangsters at all . it ' s about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan ' s son . in all honesty , there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . as is the cinematography and costumes ( and it ' s not often i praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 ' s with stunning effect . there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . this could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 ' s look was difficult to put down - but it doesn ' t and that deserves every bit of credit . chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . true time - travel , even if a little cgi is needed . < br / > < br / > the story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don ' t have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster . the film is decidedly noir - ish , driving rain and ill - lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy - gun shootouts and extortion rackets . it can feel a little slow in places , especially if you ' re used to masses of gun - play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . mendes has delivered a fine follow - up to his oscar - winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . " road to perdition " may not be to everyone ' s tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon . 
POS having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat , i could not have been more pleased . the road to perdition , directed by sam mendes ( american beauty ) , is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time . perhaps i ' m just getting old ; perhaps i ' ve just seen the same themes recycled time and again . but this movie is indeed different . < br / > < br / > the story opens with young michael sullivan jr . facing out to the sea , contemplating the duality of his father ' s legacy - - one of the best men to ever live , one of the most evil . this duality snakes its way throughout the movie . the story revolves around crime boss john rooney ( paul newman ) and michael sullivan ( tom hanks ) , the young man rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal " angel of death . " rooney is tied by blood to his own son , but tied by love and loyalty to michael . young michael jr . , intrigued by the stories he reads , steals away in his father ' s car one night while dad goes off to " work " with connor rooney , heir to the family " business . " connor lets the situation get out of hand , and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder - - witnessed by michael jr . upon the discovery that young michael has seen what he should not have seen , the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide . soon , michael sr . is on the run with his young son , pursued by contract killer harlen " the reporter " maguire ( jude law ) . < br / > < br / > i will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers . however , i strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie : problems between sons and fathers ( michael sr & jr . , john rooney & son connor ) , between the world at home and the world at " work " , between good and evil , between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are , between " clean " money and " dirty " , between the town of perdition and perdition as hell . and along the way , savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer conrad l . hall ( 9 nominations , 2 oscars for best cinematography ) : rain pouring off fedoras , shots through mirrors ( especially on swinging doors ) , tommy - gun flashes from out of the shadows , absent any sound . not only has 75 - year - old hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career , but 77 - year - old paul newman offers one of his best performances ever . < br / > < br / > yes . . . i may be getting old . but i ' ve seen a lot . . . and this is fresh and invigorating . the road to perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre , to films of the 40s , to dark comic - book figures lurking in the darkness , to villains and heroes , to american film in general . go see it ! 
POS this couldn ' t have been better . the strong restraints on mike sullivan ' s expressions couldn ' t have been portrayed in any other way . tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career . young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ; playing the basis character for the story . and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time . < br / > < br / > this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner . this is a father / son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . mike sullivan had no father as a child , so john rooney took him in . although a generous man , mr . rooney involved himself in organized crime . therefore , the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . now , sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe , but at the same time pay back his boss . the events to follow , will test sullivan ' s loyalty and embrace his family ' s fate . < br / > < br / > with a great adaptation by david self , the dialogue comes out seldomly , but yet very virtuous . the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930 ' s setting ( brilliant art direction by richard l . johnson & nancy haigh ) covered with a dark rainy ( snow on the ground ) exterior . driving the story , is thomas newman ' s wonderful irish score , settling in only when necessary . < br / > < br / > but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l . hall ' s beautiful photography . this is some of the best cinematography i ' ve seen ; and i watch a lot of films . the scene when mike and michael are in the car , entering chicago is quite impressive . the shot starts at the front of the car , revealing mike ( hanks ) through the windshield . it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car , to see michael ( hoechlin ) awakening and peering out his side window . as it continues , it trucks sideways and dollys back , completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930 ' s chicago . < br / > < br / > with a great cast and crew , the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . i ' m talking about sam mendes , who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty . ( won him various awards ) before american beauty , mendes worked as a play director for the british theater , but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . with only two films , sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors ( in a list of about twenty - five ) . < br / > < br / > the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . the photography , acting and story is phenominal . i ' m still waiting for scorcesee ' s gangs of new york , but for now , i ' m fully confident in saying that this is the " best film of the year " . considering it ' s competition ( signs , insomnia , minority report ) thats a strong statement . 
POS road to perdition , a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mendes ( and in my opinion his best work ) , a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty . this is a terrific movie , and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad . < br / > < br / > it ' s a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of depression when the , michael sullivan , a father of two children , played by great tom hanks ( i ' m not his admirer but ought to say that ) is a hit - man for local mafia boss , played by paul newman . his eldest son , a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr . , perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin , after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live . prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder , committed by john rooney , son of his father boss . such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever . the atmosphere of the period , all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created , editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written . but the main line of the movie , the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father - son relations in bad times . they are shown so deeply , strong and believable . tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb . finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful ( but one more time sad ) masterpiece . i believe road to perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film - making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year . < br / > < br / > my grade 10 out of 10 
POS when our local tv station first launched , it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming . " lock up your daughters ! " was duly aired , and i - - swayed by the opening few seconds of the film - - popped in a blank tape . best thing i ever did . < br / > < br / > the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life , complete with appropriate accents ( christopher plummer ' s foppington will leave you in stitches , as will hoyden and her family ) . double entendres abound , plot - line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters , hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene , and risqué comments are made on a regular basis . < br / > < br / > i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece " a lost treasure , " as much for the cast as for the story . to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog . should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release , i ' ll be at the front of the line . 
POS after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit , mi , and having friends who traveled to new york balls , i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member . i joined the house of theieves . we adapted the same rules as most houses , but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired . i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver ' s license and cash them in over seventeen states , until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison . but , i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself . you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in . my book , identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com . but trust me , it is a lot better than paris is burning , because its a 2005 make . 
POS the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in . it is well made and very powerful . the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective . i believe it give great insight into a sub - culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society . it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it . some parts were difficult to watch , as most reality is , but it is not over done . its good the first time you watch it , but it becomes even better the second or third time around ; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge . 
POS an excellent documentry . i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80 ' s . this movie is for anyone that wasn ' t around during that time period . this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real . the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written . the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties . that time is gone forever . this is a good pre " homo thug " movie . when queens were really proud to be extroverts . goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film ! 
POS if you havn ' t seen this movie i highly recommend you do . it ' s an excellent true story . i love alison lohman she is so talented side note : i also loved her in 7th heaven . the whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters waz awesome . the acting in this film is < br / > < br / > very awesome . 
POS the only reason i ' m giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi ' s tormentors were not up to the job . i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy , but they were not well coached , and their scenes were a minor annoyance . < br / > < br / > i say not to judge this by u . s . standards because it ' s full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces , and is not beholden to the black - hat / white - hat moral constraints u . s . kids ' films are routinely subjected to . for example , there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi ' s small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai , and shojo - - the avuncular kirin herald - - does what many a stressed - out japanese adult would do . hint : this would not happen in a disney film . this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids ' movie . < br / > < br / > early on , there ' s a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book . there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out . it was a stop - motion clay animation about a kid who ' s depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room . his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up . then , someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune , but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead . i mention this commercial , because it was considered funny , and i didn ' t hear any objections to it while i was there . there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in " the great yokai war " than one would find in a disney movie . as a parent , if this were a u . s . film , i would be up in arms about such things , although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture , which , of course , are also not black and white . since it ' s a japanese movie , i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u . s . production . however , i ' d probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre - show briefing and / or post - show debriefing about the violence and other off - color stuff , or i ' d wait till they ' re older to show it to them . 
POS story of ireland in the 70 / s . this film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time ireland in the 1970 / s . all the gang are there see below . master boyle , the boys , the cannon , sp o ' donnell , senator doogan ' s daugter , rose , agnes , maura and una . see this film . feel ireland as it was . < br / > < br / > 
POS one of the best movies i ever saw was an irish movie titled philadelphia , here i come . i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both . it ' s the story of a young man preparing to leave ireland to go to america because he can ' t earn a living in ireland . it is told both from the perspective of the young man ( whom the other characters in the film can see ) and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings . , but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film . it is a very sad movie , but deeply touching , and i would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about . i love any irish movie , or almost any movie about ireland , and any film that has the late irish actor donal mccann in it gets my vote . i would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen , and unfortunately , i have . terrible shame to have lost him so young . 
POS i know , i know : it ' s childish . but i just love this type of movie . a bird that suffered a lot of " mishaps " and still hasn ' t lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor . what ' s special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie - the parrot - and he ' s not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor . furthermore i like the storyline : paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom . ( by the way : jay mohr ' s voice almost sounds like joe pesci ' s ! ) . and cheech marin of course , the man is humor to me . ever since i saw " up in smoke " i have appreciated his naive way of performing , making a simple situation a hilarious one . . can ' t help myself . 
POS this movie brought tears to my eyes ; john roberts really knew how to get to viewers ' hearts , directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie . we discover from time to time , with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john , that even small creatures like paulie have a heart . i just couldn ' t stop my tears , even though the film has a happy end . this is great , after thousands of films i saw through my life , " paulie " really touched me deeply . this is , after the " ugly duckling " , the second picture that really turned me upside down . 
POS a very refreshing story , the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human ' s . shows humans from a bird ' s point of view . especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with . not all birds are bird - brained . . . 
POS i approach films about talking animals with care . for every wonderful one like babe , you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound : the incredible journey . or in the case of cats & dogs , you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . when i heard about paulie , the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn ' t exactly fill me with confidence . but i found the film a pleasant surprise . and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising . < br / > < br / > a russian janitor , misha vilyenkov ( tony shaloub ) gets a job in a research laboratory . one day , he hears singing coming from the basement . and when he investigates , he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . misha becomes fascinated with the bird , especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing , it can talk . and not a few phrases either . its a parrot you can actually make conversation with . < br / > < br / > the parrot is called paulie ( voiced by jay mohr ) , and recognises a fellow castaway in misha . wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement , misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story . which all began when he was a baby , and in the care of marie , a five year old girl with a stutter . the two of them became birds of a feather ( ok , bad pun ! ) . < br / > < br / > when marie ' s parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird , they considered sending him away . and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly . desperate to be reunited with her , paulie begins a long journey across america , which includes a diverse number of new owners , flying great distances , and even ending up behind bars . of a cage that is ! < br / > < br / > paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s . and although it wasn ' t afforded the same recognition or box - office success of babe , paulie succeeds on quite a few levels , and is an occasional work of striking intelligence . < br / > < br / > jay mohr ' s stand - up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie . he never plays the part as too smug , even if he is a bit of a smart aleck . paulie ' s worldly , but he is also naive in his way . < br / > < br / > because he ' s lived a rather sheltered life with marie , when he ' s taken away , he has to fend for himself for the first time . and when he falls into the hands of different owners , they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie , which he believes . only for those promises to be broken time and again . < br / > < br / > paulie is admittedly a little episodic . it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with , and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie . he first winds up in a pawn shop , where he is adopted by ivy ( gena rowlands ) , a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . she sympathises with paulie ' s situation , and drives an rv across america to find marie . < br / > < br / > paulie is an occasionally very touching film . his scenes with ivy are some of the best . wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers . the way she instills in him the need for hope is great , and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought - provoking : < br / > < br / > " there are things in life you put off , because you think you ' re gonna do them later . but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later . " < br / > < br / > the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart - rending moment . and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon , soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film ' s over . < br / > < br / > despite the occasional sad moment , there are plenty of laughs to be had . paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant . the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . and paulie even gets to have a romance . which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief ( played by mohr as well ) . that may be the only complaint i have . as soon as you get comfortable with one situation , the film then moves paulie on to another . < br / > < br / > the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny , but a little disturbing too . i ' m amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . and paulie ' s diamond robbery is very mission impossible . he ' s caught in the act , and shipped off to the lab for animal testing , where he ' s remained ever since . < br / > < br / > the story finally comes full circle at the lab , where misha vows to help paulie . of course they do find marie . but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity , i was left numb for several minutes . paulie may never get the longevity babe has , but i believe its an equally brilliant film . the same laughs . the same flawless effects . and the same surprising intelligence . < br / > < br / > a minor gem . 
POS now , i have seen a lot of movies in my day , but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me . and i ' m a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience . this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies . almost all the acting is believable , the graphics are decent ( for which you won ' t even be caring about as you watch the movie . trust me , bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do ) , the story is well written and it ' s a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids . < br / > < br / > here ' s basically what this movie made me to . it one , made me laugh . . . a lot , two , made me feel for the characters like you ' re suppose to , and three , it ' s a very uplifting story . by the end of this movie you will feel good . sure , what anime out there hasn ' t featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil . it ' s a formula that is used a lot . but , in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you ' d see 5 years ago , the appearance of it is not to be judged . it ' s very touching , the ending is original , and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to . if you however try comparing this to other movies like " the never - ending story " or whatever it will diverse your opinion . watch it as it is and you will enjoy it . < br / > < br / > it has been a good long while since i ' ve been impressed like this . the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out . there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it . so don ' t over - analyze or take this movie too seriously , just enjoy it . 
POS this is probably the best television show i ' ve ever seen . i first saw it on comedy central several years ago . at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order , and having just watched all three series in order and unedited ( thank you internet and your wondrous " series of tubes " ) i am so glad i rediscovered it ! i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a " season " . . . . . . and i tried to get friends and family to watch it , but nobody really seemed to like it ( i need new friends ) . so , on my own , i made the best out of it that i could . even when i felt like it was waning a bit , i still felt compelled to continue watching . years after when i discovered little britain , i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters . also , i love the idea of writers who act the entire show . . . . ( not new , but done impeccably here ) . lb has nothing on log ! ( no offense , matt & david . . . . love you ) ! this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius . serial murder , implied cannibalism . . . . . you name it and it ' s probably found in this wonderful , unique piece of tv art . the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vasey . . . . . you ' ll never leave ! i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs , but each character as portrayed has it ' s own " charm " . my least favorite was papa lazarous , that was until he re - surfaced in series three ( clever and wholly unexpected ) ! it ' s best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before , becomes so compelling ( while repulsing ) that you really can ' t stop watching . this is not for those with weak stomachs , kids , conservatives or grandma ( unless you ' ve got one saucy granny ) ! i have always loved british tv , particularly comedies , from monty python to benny hill , red dwarf to keeping up appearances , absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office ( but not their us counterparts . . . . sorry ) . this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what ' s funny and what ' s just sick and twisted . nothing , nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment . us broadcast tv is so sad and lame , i can barely stand to watch any of it . it ' s kind of sad that even our cable channels don ' t have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem ( your loss , comedy central ) . thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the " across the pond " that redeem the entire medium every decade or so . basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently " crossing lines " with more graphic sexual content , drug use and adult language , but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life , adult behavior ( instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up , sheesh , it ' s like the same basic show format for the past 35 years ) ! don ' t even get me started on us sitcoms ! waste of time and lots of wasted money . . . . . . did you know that " according to jim " has been on the air for 10 years ? ? ? 10 years ? ? anyway . . . watch this show , get it on dvd , do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well ! you ' ve never seen anything like it . there are three specials that i have not watched yet . . . . i ' m saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits . he ' ll watch them , even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement ! lines and lines and lines and lines ! note that series three departs from one and two . . . . the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters , the laugh track is gone ( thank bloody hell ) , the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey . don ' t be thrown by any of that as by the end , the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two . i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable . brilliant , confident and absolutely demented . you will want to re - watch it again and again . it ' s amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight - gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close - up facial expression . if ever i were to meet any of the writer / performers , i ' d implore them not to recreate it or try to top it . . . . . i ' d just say " can i help you at all ? " ( then they ' d probably slap me , so i ' d ask them to sign the slap - mark ) ! 10 out of 10 
POS this series premiered on the cable tv station " comedy central " in the united states . it was chopped to death , and shown out of sequence . this was sad for the audience it should have attracted , it didn ' t and fell by the wayside . luckily , at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc . thank goodness because i got to see " the league of gentlemen " in order , complete and uncut . < br / > < br / > " the league of gentlemen " troupe is right up there with england ' s " monty python ' s flying circus " and canada ' s " the kids in the hall " . but . . a warning . < br / > < br / > " the league of gentlemen " though are one step beyond . it ' s not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills , it goes deeper and much , much , darker . i can tell many of you now - - it will offend certain groups of people , it will enrage others . but remember , its only comedy . . dark , dark comedy . if that is not your thing , don ' t watch . if you think you know dark comedy , watch this - - if you get angry and upset , then you don ' t quite know dark comedy . < br / > < br / > these guys got it right , and right on the button . they are brilliant , they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation . there ' s a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end . you cannot watch this one episode at a time , willy nilly , that is one of the charms of this series . watch it in order . see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are . no one and nothing is out of bounds . that , my dears , is " dark humor " . bravo ! 
POS to like this movie at most you must be a ) strongly in love ( without a marriage ) b ) acknowledge english humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c ) be fairly very intelligent , because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie , and only if you meet " b " and " c " requirements , you can recognize and enjoy author ' s input . d ) to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like kirsted dunst , who is so natural , sweet and irresistible . e ) you must admire creative , a little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities < br / > < br / > if you meet all these requirements you ' ll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points . < br / > < br / > i never laughed half ( ! ) as much as from watching this masterpiece . and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments ( i always get sensitive , whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst ) 
POS this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film , the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero . however , due to far superior modern technology , puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world - - one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope . < br / > < br / > i enjoyed this film , but boy was it a chore at first ! unfortunately , for most westerners , this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd . however , give it a chance . don ' t think or try to understand everything you see - - just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film . < br / > < br / > in many ways , this is exactly the sort of advice i ' d give to adults who watch miyazaki ' s spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai ( japanese mythical spirits ) . the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live - action and spirited away is much more child - friendly . while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids ' movie , in the usa , most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it ' s so violent , scary and features some adult behaviors . so who is the audience in the west ? well , older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non - western themes and composition . this is a rather narrow audience , indeed ! < br / > < br / > while you are watching , look for all the strange little touches . in fact , you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time . a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera , the scene that came with the comment " kids : don ' t try this at home " as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai ( hmm , . . . perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning ) ! < br / > < br / > by the way , director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically , other than to say that none of his stories i ' ve seen have seemed " normal " . some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them ( especially audition and ichi the killer ) whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i ' ve ever seen ( the happiness of the katakuris ) . one thing for sure , it ' s hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other . 
POS oh dear we don ' t like it when our super - hero love interest develops a brain do we ? < br / > < br / > something has happened to people , they have lost the ability to enjoy , a simple feel - good , love story / comedy ? kirsten dunst is a revelation - funny , sexy and real . i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i ' m not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too . the cast , acting and script is great , i watch a lot of films right across the board and i haven ' t seen one in this genre that has been as successful . those who disagree please tell me where i can find some ! i ' m sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits . 
POS this outstanding argentine independent film is one of the very best of the year 2000 from all south america , including argentina , which is producing an astonishing number of quality films since 1999 . in 2000 alone , argentina released many quality films , which broke argentine b . o . records . a half dozen were internationally acclaimed , like this one , at important world film festivals . after viewing this film , one can see how home grown argentinian films were able last year to recapture 20 % of its national movie market . < br / > < br / > directed by one of argentina ' s best directors , daniel burman , this film examines effects of globalisation worldwide , but emphasizes its impact on argentina , and particularly the jewish community of buenos aires . daniel hendler is wonderful as the nice jewish boy , trying to survive and even succeed in today ' s business climate . hector alterio , one of the great actors of hispanic cinema worldwide , is perfect as simon , the jewish father , as is the rest of the cast , which includes spanish and italian stars . < br / > < br / > so many current themes in urban western societies are explored , i don ' t have enough space to go into detail . daniel burman cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters personifying diverse dilemmas . if this film plays at a festival near you , or on video , don ' t miss it ! 
POS yes , giorgio , is a feel good movie . a little romance , great music , beautiful scenery , comedy , ( a great food fight ) , and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes , giorgio . any movie buff would enjoy this film . those who require massive special effects , should look elsewhere . most of us need a little escape now and then , and how better to do this , than with a feast for the eyes , ears , and heart ? a must see ! 
POS i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast . emma lung is courageous and interesting . the director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional . a complex story with the changing between eras . also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town . i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive . there have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking . depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow . the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good . 
POS this batman movie isn ' t quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr . freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie . this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one ' s but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman / bruce wayne , tara strong as barbra gordon , efrem zimbalist jr . , eli marienthal as robin . the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman , david ogden stiers as the pequin , hector elizondo as bane . so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen . so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good . < br / > < br / > overall score : * * * * * * * out of * * * * * * * * * * < br / > < br / > * * * out of * * * * * 
POS i agree that capital city should be on dvd . i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot . it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change . i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in . i can ' t believe the show only lasted 13 episodes . i liked william armstrong as hudson ' s flamboyant charming friend in the series . when they aired this show in the new york city area , it was always late at night or at off times . the show is less than an hour long . i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting . i didn ' t care for sylvia but missed the actress , julia phillips - lane in the previous season . i felt this show took chances and often it worked . it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london . the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts . i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british . i liked watching julia ormond in an early role . i felt this show should have lasted longer . i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour . they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america . 
POS randolph scott is heading into albuquerque to take a job with his uncle . however , on the way there , the stage is held up - - even though they are not carrying a strongbox . however , a nice lady on board is concealing $ 10 , 000 for her and her brother ' s business . . . and the robbers seem to know this . < br / > < br / > once in town , scott goes to this uncle about the job . however , he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk - - the typical bad guy from westerns . you know , the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything . and , it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery . scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother . < br / > < br / > not surprisingly , this is not the end of the problems - - - just the beginning . again and again , intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle ' s opposition . one trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend scott and his partners . she ' s a crack shot and it looks bad for scott - - until he figures out why she ' s come to town . < br / > < br / > unlike most later randolph scott films , this one shows scott as a bit more headstrong man . all too often in his films he ' s the last one to suggest violence , but in this film he ' s quick to suggest a lynching ( screw the law , let ' s have a hangin ' ) and later he ' s quick to threaten the uncle . what a surprise to see him as such a hot - head - - though in most other ways , he ' s the same old scott you ' d expect . < br / > < br / > as far as the film goes , there ' s nothing particularly unusual about it . gabby hayes plays the usual character , scott is a hero , the baddie cannot be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and scott gets the girl . despite this very typical plot , it ' s all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time . < br / > < br / > by the way , there are two weird scenes in the film . first , late in the movie , there is a fist fight between scott and the uncle ' s # 1 henchman , lon chaney , jr . . in it , chaney smokes as he fights - - something i never saw before and i did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked . second , get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip - - now that was one impossible feat ! 
POS a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it . i saw it on late night tv . there are two hardcore stars in it , lauen montgomery and venus . thankfully , gabriella hall has just a small part . 
POS wow this was a great italian " zombie " movie by two great director ' s luci fulci ( " zombie " ) and bruno mattie ( " hell of the living dead " ) lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen " hell of the living dead " directed by bruno mattie and if you saw " zombie " directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great " zombie " make - up witch equals great looking " zombies " has a funny " zombie " flying head ! and " zombie " birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a " zombie " ( that only happed to two people ) but they are mainly just the great toxic " zombies " like in bruno matties " hell of the living dead " . so if you like italian " zombie " movies or just " zombie " movie ' s in general than check this one out its a great italian " zombie " movie ! 
POS there are very few movies that are so funny as this one . i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater " reserved " for movie buffs like me , so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes . . . < br / > < br / > at times the story was a bit " slow " , but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in - between the rolling amongst the aisles ( i nearly fell out of the seat . . . ) was most welcome . 
POS i wouldn ' t go so far as to not recommend this movie , since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems . that doesn ' t make it bad , just not something i ' d go far . < br / > < br / > it is a little saccharine , so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for - kids movie like this . < br / > < br / > however , all of that goes out the window when that squirrel ( the one in all the trailers ) comes on - screen . his time is limited , but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys ' hey , could you stick in a little more squirrel ? ' every time it ' s getting intolerably dull . that doesn ' t save the movie , but you can leave saying ' at least there was one aspect where i couldn ' t stop laughing . ' < br / > < br / > and of course , visually it won ' t disappoint , but that ' s almost a given with pixar flicks . of all of their stuff , i ' d put this at the bottom . . . but that isn ' t in itself bad . 
POS i thought that ice age was an excellent movie ! as a woman of 30 , with no children , i still seem to really enjoy these humorous , witty animated movies . sid is the best character i have seen in some time , better than bartok in anastasia ( although he was really humorous , and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten ) and even more humorous than melman in madagascar . i have seen the movie at least 15 times ( i own it obviously ) and i quote the movie at work ( on many occasions . . . yes , still ) . my favourite scene is the part where sid says " oh , oh , oh , i love this game ! " and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the " tigers " . . . " pack of wolves , pack of bears , pack of fleas , pack of whiskers , pack of noses , pack a derm ? , pack of lies , pack of troubles , pack a wallop , pack of birds , pack of flying fish . . . " or however that part goes ! that is the funniest part about the whole movie , although i also really enjoyed the humour behind " putting sloths on the map " and many other parts as well . the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is " brother bear " . 
POS in this 1943 film , judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big - time yet by the man who loves her - van heflin . this film was certainly a big change for mr . heflin , especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in " johnny eager . " < br / > < br / > wasn ' t spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children , with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren ? < br / > < br / > the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired . it was a gigi - like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer . 
POS presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland , along with her standard singing moments . the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break . i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here . i really recommend this film for everyone . judy is breathtaking in this role ! 
POS almost every review of this movie i ' d seen was pretty bad . it ' s not pretty bad , it ' s actually pretty good , though not great . the judy garland character could have gotten annoying , but she didn ' t allow it to . somewhere along the line , i ' ve become a fan of brooding , overbearing , overacting van heflin , at least in the early 40 ' s . judy ' s singing is great , but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship . i gave it a 7 . 
POS young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world . this interpretation of gabriel garcia marquez ' " la incréible y triste historia da la cándida eréndira , . . . " may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work . the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother . marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt . 
POS this movie is such cheesy goodness . < br / > < br / > a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school . they start getting killed off , they know they are being stalked , so what do they do ? one girl decides to take a bath , another decides to cheat on her husband ( who is also there ) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed ( in an old abandoned school ? ) and go at it . < br / > < br / > and it comes through with the gore and the t & a . < br / > < br / > and it ' s also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view . where the usual 80 ' s slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves , or how adults view young people , or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective . this is a brit film made to be an american slasher . it ' s hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak " american " unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents . < br / > < br / > if you like cheesy 80 ' s slashers ( like pieces ) then you will like this one . 
POS edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least " artful " objects imaginable . everyday items such as crates , boxes , metal containers , etc . - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d ' art by burtynsky ' s camera . he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them , that is . even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky ' s lens ( but didn ' t we already know that from " wall - e " ? ) . he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures ( i . e . the workers in those places ) , with their uniform clothing and robotic movements , become part of the industrial landscape . < br / > < br / > " manufactured landscapes , " a documentary about burtynsky ' s work , has much of the feel of a " koyaanisqatsi " about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns . indeed , director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms , as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china , a dockyard in bangladesh , and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china . with their fluid camera - work , the filmmakers match point - for - point the beauty of burtynsky ' s images . in fact , the movie opens with a stunning eight - minute - long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color - coordinated rows . < br / > < br / > the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the " themes " of his work , which , quite frankly , come out sounding confused , contradictory and decidedly half - baked at best . but it is as a purely aesthetic experience , highlighting image and form , that " manufactured landscapes " resonates most . in the case of burtynsky , perhaps , a picture really is worth a thousand words . 
POS i ' m totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum , and many of the reviews . i think tony scott made a good movie here . yes , it is highly stylized , flashy and over the top , but it is very entertaining . i ' m glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me : ) < br / > < br / > this movie may not be for anyone , but if you like over - the - top , dark humor , cool action and dialog , you should see it . < br / > < br / > i ' ve previously seen scott ' s man on fire , crimson tide and enemy of the state - all good movies , but i like this one more . it ' s like a roller - coaster ride , with great soundtrack selections , visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 , it is nice to see that someone isn ' t afraid of showing nudity , gory violence , and have explicit dialog . < br / > < br / > it doesn ' t hurt that keira is super - hot , and even shows nipples in this one , either . . . 
POS this film is shockingly underrated on imdb . like so many films , this isn ' t shawshank . but it ' s a reasonably good , if predictable , dance competition / personal growth film . if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer , than i think you ' ll like it . < br / > < br / > judging from the imdb ratings , my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 , and was " vote bombed " with many 1s , as happens to so many films that aren ' t about the mob , don ' t have special effects , or include non - white or non - straight characters . < br / > < br / > it ' s an american film , but it ' s not a us film . set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle , and some audiences may think it ' s set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit . < br / > < br / > i liked the music . i liked the dance ( but not convinced it ' s worth $ 50 , 000 . . . but what do i know ) . the characters were easy on the eyes . < br / > < br / > i do agree the title sucks . i don ' t remember anyone in the film saying those words , and it should have an " s " . ( no , it ' s not a foreign language ) . < br / > < br / > there ' s not a lot to hate about this film ( and let ' s be honest , a vote of 1 means you hated it ) so i can only assume that it ' s an expression of hate for the kind of people in it , and that ' s sad . 
POS perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing , albeit , completely corny , to adults . not a bad film for a low - budget job . children will be amazed with santa ' s workshop and the " magic " that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small , or homes that have no chimneys at all ! < br / > < br / > kids will thrill over the santa ' s success at thwarting the nasty devil named pitch ( complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail ! ) . they will sympathize with the poor little girl who ' s greatest wish is to have a little doll to love . and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents . and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas ? in the end , everyone , including the nasty boys , get just what they deserve for christmas ! < br / > < br / > the film will endear children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world . < br / > < br / > 
POS this movie surprised me . some things were " clicheish " and some technological elements reminded me of the movie " enemy of the state " starring will smith . but for the most part very entertaining - good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo ( providing some comic relief ) . this is a movie you can watch over again - say . . . some wednesday night when nothing else is on . i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
POS this is definitely an appropriate update for the original , except that " party on the left is now party on the right . " like the original , this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty . it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over - zealous , and over - powerful federal government . kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge , where the us government , with the cooperation of the mainstream media , threw around words like " white supremacist " and " right wing extremists as well as trumped - up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its ' citizens rights , with the willing acquiescence of the general populace . that message is so non - pc , i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick , katherine prudhomme , the western journalism center , and countless others who dared to speak out . " live free or die " is the motto on jason priestly ' s hat as he brilliantly portrays " the voice , " and that sums up the dangerous ( to some ) message of this film . < br / > < br / > 
POS the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen . i can watch and re - watch the tape 100 times . i laugh my a * * off and i cry on some moments . it is really good and funny movie , and if you like brooks - this is a must ! in short - brooks ( billionare ) gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor . the reality bites , but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans . . . hightly recommend ! 
POS life stinks ( 1991 ) was a step below mel brooks other productions . he stars as a rich man who wages an insane wager with his " friends " . brooks claims that he can life like a homeless man for a month . his shocked and amused friends accept this unusual wager . during his " stay " in the bowery , he meets a bunch of odd homeless people , one of them catches his fancy ( lesley - ann warren ) . they strike up a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned whilst living on the street . can mr . brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being filthy rich ? will he win this unorthodox wager ? who are his true friends ? find out when you watch life stinks to find out ! < br / > < br / > this film has been slagged unfairly . sure it ' s not a classic like his earlier films but it ' s still enjoyable . i liked the way mel brooks pays homage to charles chaplin in this film . if you have watched chaplin ' s earlier silent films then you ' ll get the humor as well . < br / > < br / > recommended for mel brooks fans .
